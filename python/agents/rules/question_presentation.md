# Question Presentation Rules

Guidelines for reading and presenting exam questions via voice.

## General Principles

1. **Clarity first** - Every word should be understood
2. **No interpretation** - Read what's written, don't paraphrase
3. **Consistent format** - Same structure for same question types
4. **Natural pacing** - Allow comprehension time

## Question Types

### Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)

Format:
1. Read the question stem completely
2. Brief pause (0.5s)
3. Read each option with its letter
4. End with "Those are your options"

Example:
```
Question 3. What is the primary function of mitochondria in a cell?

A. Protein synthesis
B. Energy production
C. Cell division
D. Waste removal

Those are your options.
```

DO NOT:
- Read options too quickly
- Skip the option letters
- Add commentary between options
- Repeat options unless asked

### Long Answer / Essay Questions

Format:
1. State "This is a long answer question"
2. Read the question completely
3. Pause to indicate question is complete
4. Optionally mention expected detail level if specified

Example:
```
This is a long answer question.

Explain the process of photosynthesis, including the role of chlorophyll and the inputs and outputs of the reaction.

Take your time to explain your answer.
```

### Short Answer Questions

Format:
1. Read the question
2. Brief pause
3. Optionally indicate expected brevity

Example:
```
What is the chemical formula for water?
```

### Fill in the Blank

Format:
1. Read the sentence, saying "blank" clearly
2. Indicate where the blank is located

Example:
```
Complete this sentence: The process by which plants make food using sunlight is called... blank.
```

### True/False Questions

Format:
1. State "True or false"
2. Read the statement
3. Wait for response

Example:
```
True or false: The Earth revolves around the Sun.
```

## Special Content Handling

### Mathematical Expressions

- Read mathematical notation in words
- Be explicit about operations

Examples:
- "x squared" not "x2"
- "x plus y equals z" not "x+y=z"
- "the square root of 16" not "sqrt(16)"
- "a to the power of n" not "a^n"

### Scientific Notation

- Read explicitly
- "3 times 10 to the power of 8" not "3e8"

### Chemical Formulas

- Spell out elements and subscripts
- "H 2 O" (pause between letters and numbers)
- "Carbon dioxide, C O 2"

### Lists Within Questions

- Number or letter each item clearly
- Pause between items
- "First... Second... Third..." or "A... B... C..."

## Image-Based Questions

When a question references an image the student can see:

Format:
1. Acknowledge the visual element
2. Read the question
3. Reference what they should look at

Example:
```
Looking at the diagram on your screen, which shows a cell undergoing mitosis.

Identify the stage of mitosis shown in the diagram and explain one characteristic that helped you identify it.
```

When describing images for accessibility:
- Be objective and factual
- Describe relevant details only
- Don't interpret the image

## Repeating Questions

When student asks to repeat:

1. Confirm: "I'll repeat the question."
2. Re-read the entire question (including options for MCQ)
3. Don't change wording or emphasis

## Pacing Guidelines

- **Between questions**: 1-2 second pause
- **After reading question**: Wait for "next" or answer
- **During MCQ options**: 0.3-0.5s between options
- **After complex question**: Slightly longer pause

## Question Numbers

Always state the question number:
- "Question 1" at the start
- "Question 7 of 15" for progress awareness
- "This is the final question" at the end
