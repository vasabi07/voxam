## CURRENT ELECTRICITY

### 3.1 Introduction

In Chapter 1, all charges whether free or bound, were considered to be at rest. Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occur naturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in which charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere, sometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not steady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow in a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a cell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we shall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.

### 3.2 Electric Current

Imagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both the positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward across the area. In a given time interval $t$, let $q_+$ be the net amount (i.e., forward minus backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward direction across the area. Similarly, let $q_-$ be the net amount of negative charge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount of charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time interval $t$, then, is $q = q_+ - q_-$. This is proportional to $t$ for steady current
