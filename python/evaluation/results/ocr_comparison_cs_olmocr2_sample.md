"Even though most people won't be directly involved with programming, everyone is affected by computers, so an educated person should have a good understanding of how computer hardware, software, and networks operate."
— Brian Kernighan

6.1 Introduction
We store many things in our home and find them out later as and when required. Sometimes we remember the exact location of a required item. But, sometimes we do not remember the exact location and in that case we need to search for the required item. A computer also stores lots of data to be retrieved later as and when demanded by a user or a program.

Searching means locating a particular element in a collection of elements. Search result determines whether that particular element is present in the collection or not. If it is present, we can also find out the position of that element in the given collection. Searching is an important technique in computer science. In order to design algorithms, programmers need to understand the different ways in which a collection of data can be searched for retrieval.
