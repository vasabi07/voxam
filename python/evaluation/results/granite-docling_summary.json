Sometimes  we remember the exact location of a required item. But,  sometimes  we  do  not  remember  the  exact location and in that case we need to search for the required item. A computer also stores lots of data to be retrieved later as and when demanded by a user or a program.\n\nSearching means locating a particular element in a collection of elements. Search result determines  whether  that  particular  element  is present in the collection or not. If it is present, we can also find out the position of that element in the given collection. Searching is an important technique in computer science. In order to design algorithms, programmers need to understand the different ways in which a collection of data can be searched for retrieval.\n\n## Activity 6.1\n\nConsider a list of 15 elements:\n\nL=[2,3,9,7,-\n\n6,11,12,17,45,23,29,\n\n31,-37,41,43].\n\nDetermine the number of comparisons linear search makes to search for key = 12.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6.2 LInear Search\n\nLinear search is the most fundamental and the simplest search method. It is an exhaustive searching technique where every  element  of  a  given  list  is  compared  with the  item  to  be  searched  (usually  referred  to  as  'key'). So,  each  element  in  the  list  is  compared  one  by  one with the key. This process continues until an element matching  the  key  is  found  and  we  declare  that  the search is successful. If no element matches the key and we have traversed the entire list, we declare the search is unsuccessful i.e., the key is not present in the list. This item by item comparison is done in the order, in which the elements are present in the list, beginning at the first element of the list and moving towards the last. Thus, it is also called sequential search or serial search. This technique is useful for collection of items that are small in size and are unordered.\n\nGiven a list numList of n elements and key value K, Algorithm 6.1 uses a linear search algorithm to find the position of the key K in numList .\n\n## Algorithm 6.1 : Linear Search\n\nLinearSearch(numList, key, n) Step 1: SET index = 0 Step 2: WHILE  index &lt; n, REPEAT Step 3 Step 3: IF numlist[index]= key THEN PRINT 'Element found at position', index+1 STOP ELSE index = index+1\n\nStep 4: PRINT 'Search unsuccessful'\n\nExample 6.1 Assume that the numList has seven elements [8, -4, 7, 17, 0, 2, 19] so, n = 7. We need to search for the key, say 17 in numList. Table 6.1 shows the elements in the given list along with their index values.\n\nTab",

Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occur naturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in which charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere, sometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not steady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow in a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a cell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we shall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.\n\n## 3.2  ELECTRIC CURRENT\n\nImagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both the positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward across the area. In a given time interval t, let q + be the net amount ( i.e., forward minus backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward direction across the area. Similarly, let q -be the net amount of negative charge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount of charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time interval t, then, is q = q + -q -. This is proportional to t for steady current\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nblished\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand the quotient\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nis defined to be the current across the area in the forward direction. (If it turn out to be a negative number, it implies a current in the backward direction.)\n\nCurrents are not always steady and hence more generally, we define the current as follows. Let \u2206 Q be the net charge flowing across a crosssection of a conductor during the time interval \u2206 t [i.e., between times t and ( t + \u2206 t )]. Then, the current at time t across the cross-section of the conductor is defined as the value of the ratio of \u2206 Q to \u2206 t in the limit of \u2206 t tending to zero,\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn SI units, the unit of current is ampere. An ampere is defined through magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following chapter. An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in domestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the order of tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in our nerves are in microamperes.\n\n## 3.3 ELECTRIC CURRENTS IN CONDUCTORS\n\nAn electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is applied. If it is free to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free charged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the ionosphere .  However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and are thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a gram of water, for example, contains approximately 10 22 molecules. These molecules are so closely packed that the ele",

Substances with well defined properties are converted by  chemical  reactions  into  other  substances  with different properties. For any chemical reaction, chemists try to find out\n\n- (a) the feasibility of a chemical reaction which can be predicted by thermodynamics ( as you know that a reaction with \u2206 G &lt; 0, at constant temperature and pressure is feasible);\n- (b) extent  to  which  a  reaction  will  proceed  can  be determined from chemical equilibrium;\n- (c) speed of a reaction i.e. time taken by a reaction to reach equilibrium.\n\nAlong  with  feasibility  and  extent,  it  is  equally important to know the rate and the factors controlling the  rate  of  a  chemical  reaction  for  its  complete understanding.  For  example,  which  parameters determine as to how rapidly food gets spoiled? How to design a rapidly setting material for dental filling? Or what controls the rate at which fuel burns in an auto engine? All these questions can be answered by the branch of chemistry, which deals with the study of  reaction  rates  and  their  mechanisms,  called chemical kinetics . The word kinetics is derived from the Greek word  'kinesis'  meaning  movement. Thermodynamics tells only about the feasibility of a reaction whereas chemical kinetics tells about the rate of  a  reaction.    For  example,  thermodynamic  data indicate that diamond shall convert to graphite but in reality the conversion rate is so slow that the change is not perceptible at all. Therefore, most people think\n\n## 3.1 3.1 Rate  of  a Rate  of  a Chemical Chemical Reaction Reaction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat diamond is forever. Kinetic studies not only help us to determine the  speed  or  rate  of  a  chemical  reaction  but  also  describe  the conditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. The factors such as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the rate  of  a  reaction.  At  the  macroscopic  level,  we  are  interested  in amounts reacted or formed and the rates of their consumption or formation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving orientation  and  energy  of  molecules  undergoing  collision",

      "markdown_preview": "100\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI n the previous chapter, we looked at life processes involved in the maintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with a notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of these movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed germinates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the course of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth were  to  be  stopped,  these  movements  would  not  happen.  Some movements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected with  growth.  A  cat  running,  children  playing  on  swings,  buffaloes chewing cud - these are not movements caused by growth.\n\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible answer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the environment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has seen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt by  living  organisms  to  use  changes  in  their  environment  to  their advantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure and fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough food so as to be able to digest it better. When bright light is focussed on our eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond to it with movement in order to protect ourselves.\n\nIf we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this movement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each kind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement in response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper, rather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends on the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement must be  connected  to  the  recognition  of  various  events  in  the environment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other words,  living  organisms  must  use  systems  providing  control  and coordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation in multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these control and coordination activities.\n\n## 6.1 6.1 ANIMALS  -  NERVOUS  SYSTEM ANIMALS  -  NERVOUS  SYSTEM\n\nIn animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and muscular tissues, which we have studied in Class IX. Touching a hot\n\nScience\n\nobject  is  an  urgent  and  dangerous situation for us. We need to detect it, and respond to it. How do we detect that we  are  touching  a  hot  object?  All information  from  our  environment  is detected by the specialised tips of some nerve cells. These receptors are usually located in our sense organs, such as the inner ear, the nose, the tongue, and so on. So gustatory receptors will detect taste while olfactory receptors will detect smell.\n\nThis  information,  acquired  at  the end of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell [Fig. 6.1 (a)], sets ",
