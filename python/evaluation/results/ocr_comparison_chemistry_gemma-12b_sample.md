that diamond is forever. Kinetic studies not only help to determine the rate of a chemical reaction but also describe the conditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. The factors such as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the rate of a reaction. At the macroscopic level, we are interested in amounts reacted or formed and the rates of their consumption or formation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving or orientation and energy of molecules undergoing collisions, are discussed.

In this Unit, we shall with average and instantaneous rate of reaction and the factors affecting these. Some elementary ideas about the collision theory of reaction rates are also given. However, in order to understand all these, let us first learn about the reaction rate.

**3.1 Rate of a Chemical Reaction**

Some reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example, precipitation of silver chloride instantly by mixing of other and other. Similarly, the speed of a reaction or the rate of a reaction can be defined as the change in concentration of a reactant or product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in terms of:

(i) the decrease in concentration of R
(ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products.

Consider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the system remains constant.
$R \rightarrow P$
[R], [P] are the concentrations one mole of the product P. If [R], and [P], are their concentrations at time $t_1$, then,
$\frac{\Delta [R]}{\Delta t} = \frac{t_2 - t_1}{4}$

$A[R] = [R]_1 - [R]_2$
$A [P] = [P]_2 - [P]_1$

The square brackets in the above expressions are used to express molar concentration.

Rate of disappearance of R = - $\frac{\Delta [R]}{t}$  ...(3.1)
