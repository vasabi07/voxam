## CURRENT ELECTRICITY

## 3.1  INTRODUCTION

el

In Chapter 1, all charges whether free or bound, were considered to be at rest. Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occur naturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in which charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere, sometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not steady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow in a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a cell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we shall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.

## 3.2  ELECTRIC CURRENT

Imagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both the positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward across the area. In a given time interval t, let q + be the net amount ( i.e., forward minus backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward direction across the area. Similarly, let q -be the net amount of negative charge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount of charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time interval t, then, is q = q + -q -. This is proportional to t for steady current

is defined to be the current across the area in the forward direction. (If it turn out to be a negative number, it implies a current in the backward direction.)

Currents are not always steady and hence more generally, we define the current as follows. Let ∆ Q be the net charge flowing across a crosssection of a conductor during the time interval ∆ t [i.e., between times t and ( t + ∆ t )]. Then, the current at time t across the cross-section of the conductor is defined as the value of the ratio of ∆ Q to ∆ t in the limit of ∆ t tending to zero,

In SI units, the unit of current is ampere. An ampere is defined through magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following chapter. An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in domestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the order of tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in our nerves are in microamperes.

## 3.3 ELECTRIC CURRENTS IN CONDUCTORS

An electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is applied. If it is free to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free charged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the ionosphere .  However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and are thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a gram of water, for example, contains approximately 10 22 molecules. These molecules are so closely packed that the ele
