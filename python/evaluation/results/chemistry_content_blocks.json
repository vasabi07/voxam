Kinetic studies not only help us to determine the speed or rate of a chemical reaction but also describe the conditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. The factors such as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the rate of a reaction. At the macroscopic level, we are interested in amounts reacted or formed and the rates of their consumption or formation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving orientation and energy of molecules undergoing collisions, are discussed.\n\nIn this Unit, we shall be dealing with average and instantaneous rate of reaction and the factors affecting these. Some elementary ideas about the collision theory of reaction rates are also given. However, in order to understand all these, let us first learn about the reaction rate.\n\n### 3.1 Rate of a Chemical Reaction\n\nSome reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example, precipitation of silver chloride occurs instantaneously by mixing of aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride. On the other hand, some reactions are very slow, for example, rusting of iron in the presence of air and moisture. Also there are reactions like inversion of cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate speed. Can you think of more examples from each category?\n\nAlso there are reactions like inversion of cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate speed. Can you think of more examples from each category?\n\nYou must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in terms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain period of time. Similarly, the speed of a reaction or the rate of a reaction can be defined as the change in concentration of a reactant or product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in terms of:\n\n(i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the reactants, or\n\n(ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products.\n\nConsider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the system remains constant.\n\nR \u2192 P\n\nOne mole of the reactant R produces one mole of the product P. If [R]\u2081 and [P]\u2081 are the concentrations of R and P respectively at time t\u2081 and [R]\u2082 and [P]\u2082 are their concentrations at time t\u2082 then,\n\n\u0394t = t\u2082 - t\u2081\n\n\u0394[R] = [R]\u2082 - [R]\u2081\n\n\u0394[P] = [P]\u2082 - [P]\u2081\n\nThe square brackets in the above expressions are used to express molar concentration.\n\nRate of disappearance of R\n\n$$\n\\text{Rate of disappearance of R} = \\frac{\\text{Decrease in concentration of R}}{\\text{Time taken}} = -\\frac{[\\text{R}]}{t}\n$$\n\nChemistry 62\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n```markdown\nRate of appearance of P\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Increase in concentration of P}}{\\text{Time taken}} = \\frac{[P]}{t}\n$$\n\n(3.2)\n\nSince, $\\Delta[R]$ is a negative quantity (as concentration of reactants is decreasing), it is multiplied with $-1$ to make the rate of the reaction a positive quantity.\n\nEquations (3.1) and (3.2) given above represent the **average rate of a reaction, $r_{av}$**.\n\nAverage rate depends upon the change in concentration of reactants or products and the time taken for that change to occur (Fig. 3.1).\n\n[Graph showing concentration of reactants and products over time with annotations for average and instantaneous rates]\n\n**Fig. 3.1: Instantaneous and average rate of a reaction**\n\n**Units of rate of a reaction**\n\nFrom equations (3.1) and (3.2), it is clear that units of rate are concentration time$^{-1}$. For example, if concentration is in mol L$^{-1}$ and time is in seconds then the units will be mol L$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. However, in gaseous reactions, when the concentration of gases is expressed in terms of their partial pressures, then the units of the rate equation will be atm s$^{-1}$.\n\nFrom the concentrations of C$_4$H$_9$Cl (butyl chloride) at different times given below, calculate the average rate of the reaction:\n\n$$\nC_4H_9Cl + H_2O \\rightarrow C_4H_9OH + HCl\n$$\n\nduring different intervals of time.\n\n| t/s | 0 | 50 | 100 | 150 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 700 | 800 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [C$_4$H$_9$Cl]/mol L$^{-1}$ | 0.100 | 0.0905 | 0.0820 | 0.0741 | 0.0671 | 0.0549 | 0.0439 | 0.0210 | 0.017 |\n\nWe can determine the difference in concentration over different intervals of time and thus determine the average rate by dividing $\\Delta[R]$ by $\\Delta t$ (Table 3.1).\n\n[Solution]\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n62 Chemical Kinetics\n```\n\n```markdown\n# Table 3.1: Average rates of hydrolysis of butyl chloride\n\naverage rate by dividing $\\Delta[R]$ by $\\Delta t$ (Table 3.1).\n\n[Solution]\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n62 Chemical Kinetics\n```\n\n```markdown\n# Table 3.1: Average rates of hydrolysis of butyl chloride\n\n| [C\u2084H\u2089Cl]\u209c\u2081 / mol L\u207b\u00b9 | [C\u2084H\u2089Cl]\u209c\u2082 / mol L\u207b\u00b9 | t\u2081/s | t\u2082/s | r\u2090\u1d65 \u00d7 10\u2074/mol L\u207b\u00b9s\u207b\u00b9 = \u2212[C\u2084H\u2089Cl]\u209c\u2082 \u2212 [C\u2084H\u2089Cl]\u209c\u2081 / (t\u2082 \u2212 t\u2081) \u00d7 10\u2074 |\n|----------------------|----------------------|------|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0.100                | 0.0905               | 0    | 50   | 1.90                                                                 |\n| 0.0905               | 0.0820               | 50   | 100  | 1.70                                                                 |\n| 0.0820               | 0.0741               | 100  | 150  | 1.58                                                                 |\n| 0.0741               | 0.0671               | 150  | 200  | 1.40                                                                 |\n| 0.0671               | 0.0549               | 200  | 300  | 1.22                                                                 |\n| 0.0549               | 0.0439               | 300  | 400  | 1.10                                                                 |\n| 0.0439               | 0.0335               | 400  | 500  | 1.04                                                                 |\n| 0.0210               | 0.017                | 700  | 800  | 0.4                                                                 |\n\nIt can be seen (Table 3.1) that the average rate falls from 1.90 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 mol L\u207b\u00b9s\u207b\u00b9 to 0.4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 mol L\u207b\u00b9s\u207b\u00b9. However, average rate cannot be used to predict the rate of a reaction at a particular instant as it would be constant for the time interval for which it is calculated. So, to express the rate at a particular moment of time we determine the **instantaneous rate**. It is obtained when we consider the average rate at the smallest time interval say dt (i.e. when \u0394t approaches zero). Hence, mathematically for an infinitesimally small dt instantaneous rate is given by\n\n$$ r_{av} = \\frac{-[R]}{t} = \\frac{[P]}{t} $$\n\nAs \u0394t \u2192 0 or $$ r_{inst} = \\frac{-d[R]}{dt} = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} $$\n\n[Graph showing the instantaneous rate of hydrolysis of butyl chloride (C\u2084H\u2089Cl) over time, with a marked point indicating the instantaneous rate at t = 600 seconds]\n\n**Fig 3.2**\nInstantaneous rate of hydrolysis of butyl chloride (C\u2084H\u2089Cl)\n\nChemistry 64\n\nReprint 2025-26\n```\n\nIt can be determined graphically by drawing a tangent at time t on either of the curves for concentration of R and P vs time t and calculating its slope. (Fig. 3.1). So in problem 3.1, r_inst at 600s for example, can be calculated by plotting concentration of butyl chloride as a function of time. A tangent is drawn that touches the curve at t = 600 s (Fig. 3.2).\n\nThe slope of this tangent gives the instantaneous rate.\n\nSo, r_inst at 600 s = - (0.0165 - 0.037) / (800 - 400) s = 5.12 x 10^-5 mol L^-1 s^-1\n\nAt t = 250 s r_inst = 1.22 x 10^-4 mol L^-1 s^-1\n\nt = 350 s r_inst = 1.0 x 10^-4 mol L^-1 s^-1\n\nt = 450 s r_inst = 6.4 x 10^-5 mol L^-1 s^-1\n\nNow consider a reaction\n\nHg(l) + Cl2(g) \u2192 HgCl2(s)\n\nWhere stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants and products are same, then rate of the reaction is given as\n\nRate of reaction = - [Hg] / t = - [Cl2] / t = [HgCl2] / t\n\ni.e., rate of disappearance of any of the reactants is same as the rate of appearance of the products.

Since rate of consumption of HI is twice the rate of formation of H2 or I2, to make them equal, the term \u0394[HI] is divided by 2. The rate of this reaction is given by\n\nRate of reaction = - 1/2 [HI] / t = [H2] / t = [I2] / t\n\nSimilarly, for the reaction\n\n5 Br^- (aq) + BrO3^- (aq) + 6 H^+ (aq) \u2192 3 Br2 (aq) + 3 H2O (l)\n\nRate = - 1/5 [Br^-] / t = - [BrO3^-] / t = - 1/6 [H^+] / t = 1/3 [Br2] / t = 1/3 [H2O] / t\n\nFor a gaseous reaction at constant temperature, concentration is directly proportional to the partial pressure of a species and hence, rate can also be expressed as rate of change in partial pressure of the reactant or the product.\n\n[65 Chemical Kinetics]\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n```markdown\n# Example 3.2\nThe decomposition of $\\text{N}_2\\text{O}_5$ in $\\text{CCl}_4$ at 318K has been studied by monitoring the concentration of $\\text{N}_2\\text{O}_5$ in the solution.

The representation of rate of reaction in terms of concentration of the reactants is known as **rate law**. It is also called as rate equation or rate expression.\n\n### 3.2.2 Rate Expression and Rate Constant\n\nThe results in Table 3.1 clearly show that rate of a reaction decreases with the passage of time as the concentration of reactants decrease. Conversely, rates generally increase when reactant concentrations increase.

The equation like (3.4), which relates the rate of a reaction to concentration of reactants is called rate law or rate expression. Thus, rate law is the expression in which reaction rate is given in terms of molar concentration of reactants with each term raised to some power, which may or may not be same as the stoichiometric coefficient of the reacting species in a balanced chemical equation. For example:\n\n$$2NO(g) + O_2(g) \\rightarrow 2NO_2(g)$$\n\nWe can measure the rate of this reaction as a function of initial concentrations either by keeping the concentration of one of the reactants constant and changing the concentration of the other reactant or by changing the concentration of both the reactants. The following results are obtained (Table 3.2).\n\n| Experiment | Initial [NO]/ mol L$^{-1}$ | Initial [O$_2$]/ mol L$^{-1}$ | Initial rate of formation of NO$_2$/ mol L$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ |\n|------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.         | 0.30                        | 0.30                           | 0.096                                                    |\n| 2.         | 0.60                        | 0.30                           | 0.384                                                    |\n| 3.         | 0.30                        | 0.60                           | 0.192                                                    |\n| 4.         | 0.60                        | 0.60                           | 0.768                                                    |\n\nIt is obvious, after looking at the results, that when the concentration of NO is doubled and that of O$_2$ is kept constant then the initial rate increases by a factor of four from 0.096 to 0.384 mol L$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. This indicates that the rate depends upon the square of the concentration of NO. When concentration of NO is kept constant and concentration of O$_2$ is doubled the rate also gets doubled indicating that rate depends on concentration of O$_2$ to the first power. Hence, the rate equation for this reaction will be\n\n$$Rate = k [NO]^2[O_2]$$\n\n[67 Chemical Kinetics]\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe differential form of this rate expression is given as\n\n$$\n-\\frac{d[R]}{dt} = k[NO]^2[O_2]\n$$\n\nNow, we observe that for this reaction in the rate equation derived from the experimental data, the exponents of the concentration terms are the same as their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation.\n\nSome other examples are given below:\n\n| Reaction | Experimental rate expression |\n|----------|-----------------------------|\n| 1. $CHCl_3 + Cl_2 \\rightarrow CCl_4 + HCl$ | Rate = $k[CHCl_3][Cl_2]^{1/2}$ |\n| 2. $CH_3COOC_2H_5 + H_2O \\rightarrow CH_3COOH + C_2H_5OH$ | Rate = $k[CH_3COOC_2H_5]^1[H_2O]^0$ |\n\nIn these reactions, the exponents of the concentration terms are not the same as their stoichiometric coefficients.

When a sequence of elementary reactions (called mechanism) gives us the products, the reactions are called **complex reactions**.\n\n[Chemistry 68]\n\n[Reprint 2025-26]\n\nThese may be consecutive reactions (e.g., oxidation of ethane to CO2 and H2O passes through a series of intermediate steps in which alcohol, aldehyde and acid are formed), reverse reactions and side reactions (e.g., nitration of phenol yields o-nitrophenol and p-nitrophenol).\n\n**Units of rate constant**\n\nFor a general reaction\n\n$$aA + bB \\rightarrow cC + dD$$\n\n$$Rate = k [A]^x [B]^y$$\n\nWhere $x + y = n = order of the reaction$\n\n$$k = \\frac{Rate}{[A]^x [B]^y}$$\n\n$$= \\frac{concentration}{time} \\times \\frac{1}{(concentration)^n} \\quad (where [A]=[B])$$\n\nTaking SI units of concentration, mol L^{-1} and time, s, the units of $k$ for different reaction order are listed in Table 3.3\n\n**Table 3.3: Units of rate constant**\n\n| Reaction | Order | Units of rate constant |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Zero order reaction | 0 | $\\frac{mol L^{-1}}{s} \\times \\frac{1}{(mol L^{-1})^0} = mol L^{-1} s^{-1}$ |\n| First order reaction | 1 | $\\frac{mol L^{-1}}{s} \\times \\frac{1}{(mol L^{-1})^1} = s^{-1}$ |\n| Second order reaction | 2 | $\\frac{mol L^{-1}}{s} \\times \\frac{1}{(mol L^{-1})^2} = mol^{-1} L s^{-1}$ |\n\nIdentify the reaction order from each of the following rate constants. **Example 3.4**\n\n(i) $k = 2.3 \\times 10^{-5} L mol^{-1} s^{-1}$\n\n(ii) $k = 3 \\times 10^{-4} s^{-1}$\n\n(i) The unit of second order rate constant is $L mol^{-1} s^{-1}$, therefore $k = 2.3 \\times 10^{-5} L mol^{-1} s^{-1}$ represents a second order reaction.\n\n(ii) The unit of a first order rate constant is $s^{-1}$ therefore $k = 3 \\times 10^{-4} s^{-1}$ represents a first order reaction.\n\n**3.2.4 Molecularity of a Reaction**\n\nAnother property of a reaction called molecularity helps in understanding its mechanism. **The number of reacting species (atoms, ions or molecules) taking part in an elementary reaction, which must collide simultaneously in order to bring about a chemical reaction is called molecularity of a reaction.** The reaction can be unimolecular when one reacting species is involved, for example, decomposition of ammonium nitrite.\n\n[69 Chemical Kinetics]\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n```\nNH$_4$NO$_2$ \u2192 N$_2$ + 2H$_2$O\n\nBimolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between two species, for example, dissociation of hydrogen iodide.\n\n2HI \u2192 H$_2$ + I$_2$\n\nTrimolecular or termolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between three reacting species, for example,\n\n2NO + O$_2$ \u2192 2NO$_2$", "chapter_title": "Chapter 1: Introduction to Chemical Kinetics", "section_title": "Reaction Rates", "page_start": 6, "page_end": 10}, {"text_content": "xample, dissociation of hydrogen iodide.\n\n2HI \u2192 H$_2$ + I$_2$\n\nTrimolecular or termolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between three reacting species, for example,\n\n2NO + O$_2$ \u2192 2NO$_2$\n\nThe probability that more than three molecules can collide and react simultaneously is very small.

This shows that this reaction takes place in several steps. Which step controls the rate of the overall reaction? The question can be answered if we go through the mechanism of reaction, for example, chances to win the relay race competition by a team depend upon the slowest person in the team. Similarly, the overall rate of the reaction is controlled by the slowest step in a reaction called the **rate determining step**. Consider the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide which is catalysed by iodide ion in an alkaline medium.\n\n2H$_2$O$_2$ $\\xrightarrow{\\text{I}^-}$ $\\xrightarrow{\\text{Alkaline medium}}$ 2H$_2$O + O$_2$\n\nThe rate equation for this reaction is found to be\n\nRate = $\\frac{-d[H_2O_2]}{dt}$ = k[H$_2$O$_2$][I$^-$]\n\nThis reaction is first order with respect to both H$_2$O$_2$ and I$^-$.

Species IO$^-$ is called as an intermediate since it is formed during the course of the reaction but not in the overall balanced equation. The first step, being slow, is the rate determining step. Thus, the rate of formation of intermediate will determine the rate of this reaction.\n\nThus, from the discussion, till now, we conclude the following:\n\n(i) Order of a reaction is an experimental quantity. It can be zero and even a fraction but molecularity cannot be zero or a non integer.\n\n(ii) Order is applicable to elementary as well as complex reactions whereas molecularity is applicable only for elementary reactions.

It is not always convenient to determine the instantaneous rate, as it is measured by determination of slope of the tangent at point 't' in concentration vs time plot (Fig. 3.1). This makes it difficult to determine the rate law and hence the order of the reaction. In order to avoid this difficulty, we can integrate the differential rate equation to give a relation between directly measured experimental data, i.e., concentrations at different times and rate constant.\n\nThe integrated rate equations are different for the reactions of different reaction orders. We shall determine these equations only for zero and first order chemical reactions.\n\n#### 3.3.1 Zero Order Reactions\n\nZero order reaction means that the rate of the reaction is proportional to zero power of the concentration of reactants.

Some enzyme catalysed reactions and reactions which occur on metal surfaces are a few examples of zero order reactions. The decomposition of gaseous ammonia on a hot platinum surface is a zero order reaction at high pressure.\n\n$$2NH_3 (g) \\xrightarrow{1130K}_{Pt catalyst} N_2 (g) + 3H_2 (g)$$\n\nRate = k [NH_3]0 = k\n\nIn this reaction, platinum metal acts as a catalyst. At high pressure, the metal surface gets saturated with gas molecules. So, a further change in reaction conditions is unable to alter the amount of ammonia on the surface of the catalyst making rate of the reaction independent of its concentration. The thermal decomposition of HI on gold surface is another example of zero order reaction.\n\n### 3.3.2 First Order Reactions\n\nIn this class of reactions, the rate of the reaction is proportional to the first power of the concentration of the reactant R.

There are many reactions which obey first order rate law although they are higher order reactions. Consider the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate which is a chemical reaction between ethyl acetate and water. In reality, it is a second order reaction and concentration of both ethyl acetate and water affect the rate of the reaction. But water is taken in large excess for hydrolysis, therefore, concentration of water is not altered much during the reaction. Thus, the rate of reaction is affected by concentration of ethyl acetate only. For example, during the hydrolysis of 0.01 mol of ethyl acetate with 10 mol of water, amounts of the reactants and products at the beginning (t = 0) and completion (t) of the reaction are given as under.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cccccc}\n& \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOC}_2\\text{H}_5 & + & \\text{H}_2\\text{O} & \\xrightarrow{\\text{H}^+} & \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH} & + & \\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5\\text{OH} \\\\\nt = 0 & 0.01 \\text{ mol} & & 10 \\text{ mol} & & 0 \\text{ mol} & & 0 \\text{ mol} \\\\\nt & 0 \\text{ mol} & & 9.99 \\text{ mol} & & 0.01 \\text{ mol} & & 0.01 \\text{ mol}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe concentration of water does not get altered much during the course of the reaction.

For example, in decomposition of $\\text{N}_2\\text{O}_5$, the time taken for half of the original amount of material to decompose is 12 min at $50^\\circ \\text{C}$, 5 h at $25^\\circ \\text{C}$ and 10 days at $0^\\circ \\text{C}$. You also know that in a mixture of potassium permanganate ($\\text{KMnO}_4$) and oxalic acid ($\\text{H}_2\\text{C}_2\\text{O}_4$), potassium permanganate gets decolourised faster at a higher temperature than that at a lower temperature.\n\nIt has been found that **for a chemical reaction with rise in temperature by $10^\\circ$, the rate constant is nearly doubled**.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the rate of a chemical reaction can be accurately explained by **Arrhenius equation (3.18)**. It was first proposed by Dutch chemist, J.H. van't Hoff but Swedish chemist, Arrhenius provided its physical justification and interpretation.\n\n[Chemistry 78]\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nHere is the extracted text in clean markdown format:\n\n```markdown\n$$k = A e^{-E_a / RT}$$\n\nwhere A is the Arrhenius factor or the **frequency factor**. It is also called pre-exponential factor. It is a constant specific to a particular reaction. R is gas constant and E<sub>a</sub> is activation energy measured in joules/mole (J mol<sup>-1</sup>).\n\nIt can be understood clearly using the following simple reaction\n\n$$H_2 (g) + I_2 (g) \\rightarrow 2HI(g)$$\n\nAccording to Arrhenius, this reaction can take place only when a molecule of hydrogen and a molecule of iodine collide to form an unstable intermediate (Fig. 3.6). It exists for a very short time and then breaks up to form two molecules of hydrogen iodide.\n\n3.6). It exists for a very short time and then breaks up to form two molecules of hydrogen iodide.\n\nThe energy required to form this intermediate, called **activated complex (C)**, is known as **activation energy (E<sub>a</sub>)**. Fig. 3.7 is obtained by plotting potential energy vs reaction coordinate. Reaction coordinate represents the profile of energy change when reactants change into products.\n\nSome energy is released when the complex decomposes to form products. So, the final enthalpy of the reaction depends upon the nature of reactants and products.\n\nAll the molecules in the reacting species do not have the same kinetic energy. Since it is difficult to predict the behaviour of any one molecule with precision, Ludwig Boltzmann and James Clark Maxwell used statistics to predict the behaviour of large number of molecules. According to them, the distribution of kinetic energy may be described by plotting the fraction of molecules (N<sub>E</sub>/N<sub>T</sub>) with a given kinetic energy (E) vs kinetic energy (Fig. 3.8). Here, N<sub>E</sub> is the number of molecules with energy E and N<sub>T</sub> is total number of molecules.\n\nThe peak of the curve corresponds to the **most probable kinetic energy**, i.e., kinetic energy of maximum fraction of molecules. There are decreasing number of molecules with energies higher or lower than this value.

It is clear from the diagram that in the curve at $(t + 10)$, the area showing the fraction of molecules having energy equal to or greater than activation energy gets doubled leading to doubling the rate of a reaction.\n\nIn the Arrhenius equation (3.18) the factor $e^{-E_a/RT}$ corresponds to the fraction of molecules that have kinetic energy greater than $E_a$.

For example, $\\text{MnO}_2$ catalyses the following reaction so as to increase its rate considerably.\n\n$$\n2 \\text{KClO}_3 \\xrightarrow{\\text{MnO}_2} 2 \\text{KCl} + 3 \\text{O}_2\n$$\n\nThe word catalyst should not be used when the added substance reduces the rate of reaction. The substance is then called inhibitor. The action of the catalyst can be explained by intermediate complex theory. According to this theory, a catalyst participates in a chemical reaction by forming temporary bonds with the reactants resulting in an intermediate complex. This has a transitory existence and decomposes to yield products and the catalyst.\n\nIt is believed that the catalyst provides an alternate pathway or reaction mechanism by reducing the activation energy between reactants and products and hence lowering the potential energy barrier as shown in Fig. 3.11.\n\nIt is clear from Arrhenius equation (3.18) that lower the value of activation energy faster will be the rate of a reaction.\n\nA small amount of the catalyst can catalyse a large amount of reactants. A catalyst does not alter Gibbs energy, $\\Delta G$ of a reaction. It catalyses the spontaneous reactions but does not catalyse non-spontaneous reactions. It is also found that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium constant of a reaction rather, it helps in attaining the equilibrium faster, that is, it catalyses the forward as well as the backward reactions to the same extent so that the equilibrium state remains same but is reached earlier.\n\n### 3.5 Collision Theory of Chemical Reactions\n\nThough Arrhenius equation is applicable under a wide range of circumstances, collision theory, which was developed by Max Trautz and William Lewis in 1916-18, provides a greater insight into the energetic and mechanistic aspects of reactions. It is based on kinetic theory of gases. According to this theory, the reactant molecules are\n\n[Reaction coordinate diagram showing the effect of catalyst on activation energy]\n\n**Fig. 3.11: Effect of catalyst on activation energy**\n\nChemistry 82\n\nReprint 2025-26\n```\n\n3.11: Effect of catalyst on activation energy**\n\nChemistry 82\n\nReprint 2025-26\n```\n\n```\nassumed to be hard spheres and reaction is postulated to occur when molecules collide with each other. The number of collisions per second per unit volume of the reaction mixture is known as collision frequency (Z). Another factor which affects the rate of chemical reactions is activation energy (as we have already studied). For a bimolecular elementary reaction\n\nA + B \u2192 Products\n\nrate of reaction can be expressed as\n\nRate = Z_AB e^(-E_a / RT)  (3.23)\n\nwhere Z_AB represents the collision frequency of reactants, A and B and e^(-E_a / RT) represents the fraction of molecules with energies equal to or greater than E_a. Comparing (3.23) with Arrhenius equation, we can say that A is related to collision frequency.\n\nEquation (3.23) predicts the value of rate constants fairly accurately for the reactions that involve atomic species or simple molecules but for complex molecules significant deviations are observed. The reason could be that all collisions do not lead to the formation of products. The collisions in which molecules collide with sufficient kinetic energy (called threshold energy*) and proper orientation, so as to facilitate breaking of bonds between reacting species and formation of new bonds to form products are called as effective collisions.\n\nFor example, formation of CH_3Br + OH \u2192 CH_3OH + Br methanol from bromoethane depends upon the orientation of reactant molecules as shown in Fig. 3.12. The proper orientation of reactant molecules lead to bond formation whereas improper orientation makes them simply bounce back and no products are formed.\n\n[Fig. 3.12: Diagram showing molecules having proper and improper orientation]\n\nTo account for effective collisions, another factor P, called the probability or steric factor is introduced. It takes into account the fact that in a collision, molecules must be properly oriented i.e.,\n\nRate = P Z_AB e^(-E_a / RT)\n\nThus, in collision theory activation energy and proper orientation of the molecules together determine the criteria for an effective collision and hence the rate of a chemical reaction.\n\nCollision theory also has certain drawbacks as it considers atoms/ molecules to be hard spheres and ignores their structural aspect. You will study details about this theory and more on other theories in your higher classes.\n\n* Threshold energy = Activation Energy + energy possessed by reacting species.\n\n82 Chemical Kinetics\n\nReprint 2025-26\n```\n\n```markdown\n# Intext Questions\n\n3.7 What will be the effect of temperature on rate constant?\n\n3.8 The rate of the chemical reaction doubles for an increase of 10K in absolute temperature from 298K.

The rate of a reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration of reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time. It can be expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average rate over a large interval of time. A number of factors such as temperature, concentration of reactants, catalyst, affect the rate of a reaction. Mathematical representation of rate of a reaction is given by **rate law**. It has to be determined experimentally and cannot be predicted. **Order of a reaction** with respect to a reactant is the power of its concentration which appears in the rate law equation. The order of a reaction is the sum of all such powers of concentration of terms for different reactants. **Rate constant** is the proportionality factor in the rate law. Rate constant and order of a reaction can be determined from rate law or its integrated rate equation. **Molecularity** is defined only for an elementary reaction. Its values are limited from 1 to 3 whereas order can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or even a fraction. Molecularity and order of an elementary reaction are same.\n\nTemperature dependence of rate constants is described by Arrhenius equation ($k = A e^{-E_a/RT}$). $E_a$ corresponds to the **activation energy** and is given by the energy difference between activated complex and the reactant molecules, and A (Arrhenius factor or pre-exponential factor) corresponds to the collision frequency. The equation clearly shows that increase of temperature or lowering of $E_a$ will lead to an increase in the rate of reaction and presence of a catalyst lowers the activation energy by providing an alternate path for the reaction. According to collision theory, another factor P called steric factor which refers to the orientation of molecules which collide, is important and contributes to effective collisions, thus, modifying the Arrhenius equation to $k = P Z_{AB} e^{-E_a/RT}$.\n\nChemistry 84\n\nReprint 2025-26\n```\n\n```markdown\n# Exercises\n\n## 3.1\n\nFrom the rate expression for the following reactions, determine their order of reaction and the dimensions of the rate constants.\n\n(i) $3NO(g) \\rightarrow N_2O(g)$ Rate = $k[NO]^2$\n\n(ii) $H_2O_2(aq) + 3I^-(aq) + 2H^+ \\rightarrow 2H_2O(l) + I_3^-$ Rate = $k[H_2O_2][I^-]$\n\n(iii) $CH_3CHO(g) \\rightarrow CH_4(g) + CO(g)$ Rate = $k[CH_3CHO]^{3/2}$\n\n(iv) $C_2H_5Cl(g) \\rightarrow C_2H_4(g) + HCl(g)$ Rate = $k[C_2H_5Cl]$\n\n## 3.2\n\nFor the reaction:\n\n$2A + B \\rightarrow A_2B$\n\nthe rate = $k[A][B]^2$ with $k = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol}^{-2} L^2 s^{-1}$.
