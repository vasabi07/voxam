and the quotient

turn out to be a negative number, the area in direction. (If it direction.)

Currents are not always steady and hence more generally, we define the current as the net charge flowing between times *t* and (*t* + Δ*t*). Then, the current at the time interval Δ*t*, between times *t* tending to zero, is defined as the value of the ratio Δ*Q*/Δ*t* in the limit of Δ*t* tending to zero.

$i = \lim_{ \Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$

is defined to be the current across the area in the forward direction. (If it turn out to be a negative number, the area in direction. If the current is a function of time, it is said to be varying.  The average value of the current over a time interval *T* is defined as the integral of *i(t)* over the interval *T* divided by *T*.

$i_{avg} = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T i(t) \, dt$

In SI units, the unit of current is ampere. An ampere is defined through magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following chapter. An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in domestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the order of tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in our nerves are in microamperes.

**3.3 ELECTRIC CURRENTS IN CONDUCTORS**

An electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is free to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free charged particles do exist like in the upper strata of atmosphere called the ionosphere. However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and are thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a gram of water for example, contains approximately 10<sup>22</sup> molecules. These molecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached to individual nuclei. In some materials, the electrons will still be bound, i.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied. In other materials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move within the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors, develop electric currents when an electric field is applied.

If we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly bound to each other so that electrons are not very attached to the electrolytic solutions and negative and positive charges both can move. In our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the condition is completely removed. At a given time, there is no preferential direction for the electrons.

Fix aside first the case when no electric field is present. The electrons will be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with the fixed ions. An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speed as before the collision. However, the direction of its velocity after collision is completely random. At a given time, there is no preferential direction for the electrons.
