Correction:
1. After equating dimensions, ensure there's a mention of current and potential differences (e.g., \(\sigma\), \(I\), \(\tilde{U}\), \(I'\), \(U', \tilde{\sigma} \), etc.)
2. Manual formatting edits should be雙眼 and a page border should be added around the document. These are:
   - **Introduction**:铜阴极的概述/图(Refer to Sect. 3 for better introduction design.)
   - **2-inch Gauss solenoid field**: Figure is reduced for space, but it will not affect the main text directly, and is shown for comparison.
   - **First FOCUSED Definition**: First definition of \(\sigma\), \(I\) in an approximate sense rather than a precise one.
   - **Electrostatic field \(\Due(\frac{d \vec{E}}{dx_a})\)**: The overall notation and use of \(x_a\) as the geometric axis will be used with equal forbearance.
   - **Hydrodynamic Equations**: Kinematic continuity is represented simply as \(\frac{d}{dt}(f·E) = 0\). \(f·E\) could still be expressed using a material derivative, but the mass continuity constraint will have to be included explicitly and used to write \(\rho V_i\) as a product (\(f\cdot VE/f = (f^2/V)\cdot E \)) instead of using the equation you have written.
