Chapter Three
CURRENT ELECTRICITY

3.1 Introduction
In Chapter 1, all charges whether free or bound, were considered to be at rest. Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occur naturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in which charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere, sometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not steady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow in a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a cell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we shall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.

3.2 Electric Current
Imagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both the positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward across the area. In a given time interval \( t \), let \( q_+ \) be the net amount (i.e., forward *minus* backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward direction across the area. Similarly, let \( q_- \) be the net amount of negative charge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount of charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time interval \( t \), then, is \( q = q_+ - q_- \). This is proportional to \( t \) for steady current

E l = j ρ l
or, \( E = j \rho \) \hspace{1cm} (3.11)

The above relation for **magnitudes** \( E \) and \( j \) can indeed be cast in a **vector** form. The current density, (which we have defined as the current through unit area **normal** to the current) is also directed along \( \mathbf{E} \), and is also a vector \( \mathbf{j} \) (\( \equiv j \mathbf{E}/E \)). Thus, the last equation can be written as,
\[
\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{j} \rho \tag{3.12}
\]
or, \( \mathbf{j} = \sigma \mathbf{E} \tag{3.13} \)
where \( \sigma \equiv 1/\rho \) is called the *conductivity*. Ohm’s law is often stated in an equivalent form, Eq. (3.13) in addition to Eq.(3.3). In the next section, we will try to understand the origin of the Ohm’s law as arising from the characteristics of the drift of electrons.

**3.5 Drift of Electrons and the Origin of Resistivity**

As remarked before, an electron will suffer collisions with the heavy fixed ions, but after collision, it will emerge with the same speed but in random directions. If we consider all the electrons, their average velocity will be zero since their directions are random. Thus, if there are \( N \) electrons and the velocity of the \( i^{\text{th}} \) electron (\( i = 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ ...,\ N \)) at a given time is \( \mathbf{v}_i \), then
\[
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{v}_i = 0 \tag{3.14}
\]

Consider now the situation when an electric field is present. Electrons will be accelerated due to this field by
\[
\mathbf{a} = \frac{-e \mathbf{E}}{m} \tag{3.15}
\]
where \( -e \) is the charge and \( m \) is the mass of an electron. Consider again the \( i^{\text{th}} \) electron at a given time \( t \). This electron would have had its last collision some time before \( t \), and let \( t_i \) be the time elapsed after its last collision. If \( \mathbf{v}_i \) was its velocity immediately after the last collision, then its velocity \( \mathbf{V}_i \) at time \( t \) is
\[
\mathbf{V}_i = \mathbf{v}_i + \frac{-e \mathbf{E}}{m} \ t_i \tag{3.16}
\]
since starting with its last collision it was accelerated (Fig. 3.3) with an acceleration given by Eq. (3.15) for a time interval \( t_i \). The average velocity of the electrons at time \( t \) is the average of all the \( \mathbf{V}_i \)'s. The average of \( \mathbf{v}_i \)'s is zero [Eq. (3.14)] since immediately after any collision, the direction of the velocity of an electron is completely random. The collisions of the electrons do not occur at regular intervals but at random times. Let us denote by \( \tau \), the average time between successive collisions. Then at a given time, some of the electrons would have spent

Metals have low resistivities in the range of \( 10^{-8} \) \( \Omega m \) to \( 10^{-6} \) \( \Omega m \). At the other end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics having resistivities \( 10^{18} \) times greater than metals or more. In between the tw
