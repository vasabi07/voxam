[{"text_content": "3.1  INTRODUCTION\nIn Chapter 1, all charges whether free or bound, were considered to be at\nrest. Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occur\nnaturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in\nwhich charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere,\nsometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not\nsteady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow\nin a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a\ncell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we\nshall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.\n3.2  ELECTRIC CURRENT\nImagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both\nthe positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward\nacross the area. In a given time interval t, let q+ be the net amount (i.e.,\nforward minus backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward\ndirection across the area. Similarly, let q\u2013 be the net amount of negative\ncharge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount\nof charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time\ninterval t, then, is q = q+\u2013 q\u2013. This is proportional to t for steady current\nChapter Three\nCURRENT\nELECTRICITY\nReprint 2025-26\n\n```markdown\n# Physics\n\nand the quotient\n\n$$I = \\frac{q}{t}$$\n\n(3.1)\n\nis defined to be the *current* across the area in the forward direction. (If it turn out to be a negative number, it implies a current in the backward direction.)\n\nCurrents are not always steady and hence more generally, we define the current as follows. Let $\\Delta Q$ be the net charge flowing across a cross-section of a conductor during the time interval $\\Delta t$ [i.e., between times $t$ and $(t + \\Delta t)$]. Then, the current at time $t$ across the cross-section of the conductor is defined as the value of the ratio of $\\Delta Q$ to $\\Delta t$ in the limit of $\\Delta t$ tending to zero,\n\n$$I(t) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}$$\n\n(3.2)\n\nIn SI units, the unit of current is ampere. An ampere is defined through magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following chapter. An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in domestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the order of tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in our nerves are in microamperes.\n\n## 3.3 Electric Currents in Conductors\n\nAn electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is applied. If it is free to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free charged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the *ionosphere*. However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and are thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a gram of water, for example, contains approximately $10^{22}$ molecules. These molecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached to individual nuclei. In some materials, the electrons will still be bound, i.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied. In other materials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move within the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors, develop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied.\n\nIf we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly bound to each other so that the current is carried by the negatively charged electrons. There are, however, other types of conductors like electrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move. In our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the current is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background of fixed positive ions.\n\nIn our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the current is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background of fixed positive ions.\n\nConsider first the case when no electric field is present. The electrons will be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with the fixed ions. An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speed as before the collision. However, the direction of its velocity after the collision is completely random. At a given time, there is no preferential direction for the velocities of the electrons. Thus on the average, the\n\n[Reprint 2025-26]\n\n82\n```\n\nCurrent\nElectricity\n83\nnumber of electrons travelling in any direction will be equal to the number\nof electrons travelling in the opposite direction. So, there will be no net\nelectric current.\nLet us now see what happens to such a\npiece of conductor if an electric field is applied.\nTo focus our thoughts, imagine the conductor\nin the shape of a cylinder of radius R (Fig. 3.1).\nSuppose we now take two thin circular discs\nof a dielectric of the same radius and put\npositive charge +Q distributed over one disc\nand similarly \u2013Q at the other disc. We attach\nthe two discs on the two flat surfaces of the\ncylinder. An electric field will be created and\nis directed from the positive towards the\nnegative charge. The electrons will be accelerated due to this field towards\n+Q. They will thus move to neutralise the charges. The electrons, as long\nas they are moving, will constitute an electric current. Hence in the\nsituation considered, there will be a current for a very short while and no\ncurrent thereafter.\nWe can also imagine a mechanism where the ends of the cylinder are\nsupplied with fresh charges to make up for any charges neutralised by\nelectrons moving inside the conductor. In that case, there will be a steady\nelectric field in the body of the conductor. This will result in a continuous\ncurrent rather than a current for a short period of time. Mechanisms,\nwhich maintain a steady electric field are cells or batteries that we shall\nstudy  later in this chapter. In the next sections, we shall study the steady\ncurrent that results from a steady electric field in conductors.\n3.4  OHM\u2019S LAW\nA basic law regarding flow of currents was discovered by G.S. Ohm in\n1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for flow of currents\nwas discovered. Imagine a conductor through which a current I is flowing\nand let V be the potential difference between the ends of the conductor.\nThen Ohm\u2019s law states that\n     V \u00b5 I\nor, V = R I\n(3.3)\nwhere the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance of the\nconductor. The SI units of resistance is ohm, and is denoted by the symbol\nW. The resistance R not only depends on the material of the conductor\nbut also on the dimensions of the conductor. The dependence of R on the\ndimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows.\nConsider a conductor satisfying Eq. (3.3) to be in the form of a slab of\nlength l and cross sectional area A [Fig. 3.2(a)]. Imagine placing two such\nidentical slabs side by side [Fig. 3.2(b)], so that the length of the\ncombination is 2l. The current flowing through the  combination is the\nsame as that flowing through either of the slabs. If V is the potential\ndifference across the ends of the first slab, then V is also the potential\ndifference across the ends of the second slab since the second slab is\nFIGURE 3.1 Charges +Q and \u2013Q put at the ends\nof a metallic cylinder. The electrons will drift\nbecause of the electric field created to\nneutralise the charges. The current thus\nwill stop after a while unless the charges +Q\nand \u2013Q are continuously replenished.\nFIGURE 3.2\nIllustrating the\nrelation R = rl/A for\na rectangular slab\nof length l and area\nof cross-section A.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n```markdown\n# Physics\n\n![Image of Georg Simon Ohm](image_url) [Black and white portrait of a man with text overlay]", "chapter_title": "Chapter 1: Introduction to Electric Current", "section_title": "Introduction to Electric Current", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 4}, {"text_content": "rectangular slab\nof length l and area\nof cross-section A.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n```markdown\n# Physics\n\n![Image of Georg Simon Ohm](image_url) [Black and white portrait of a man with text overlay]\n\n**Georg Simon Ohm (1787\u20131854)**\nGerman physicist, professor at Munich. Ohm was led to his law by an analogy between the conduction of heat: the electric field is analogous to the temperature gradient, and the electric current is analogous to the heat flow.\n\nidentical to the first and the same current I flows through both. The potential difference across the ends of the combination is clearly sum of the potential difference across the two individual slabs and hence equals 2V. The current through the combination is I and the resistance of the combination R_C is [from Eq. (3.3)],\n\n$$R_C = \\frac{2V}{I} = 2R$$\n\n(3.4)\n\nsince V/I = R, the resistance of either of the slabs. Thus, doubling the length of a conductor doubles the resistance. In general, then resistance is proportional to length,\n\n$$R \\propto l$$\n\n(3.5)\n\nNext, imagine dividing the slab into two by cutting it lengthwise so that the slab can be considered as a combination of two identical slabs of length l, but each having a cross sectional area of A/2 [Fig. 3.2(c)].\n\nFor a given voltage V across the slab, if I is the current through the entire slab, then clearly the current flowing through each of the two half-slabs is I/2. Since the potential difference across the ends of the half-slabs is V, i.e., the same as across the full slab, the resistance of each of the half-slabs R_1 is\n\n$$R_1 = \\frac{V}{(I/2)} = 2\\frac{V}{I} = 2R$$\n\n(3.6)\n\nThus, halving the area of the cross-section of a conductor doubles the resistance. In general, then the resistance R is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area,\n\n$$R \\propto \\frac{1}{A}$$\n\n(3.7)\n\nCombining Eqs. (3.5) and (3.7), we have\n\n$$R \\propto \\frac{l}{A}$$\n\n(3.8)\n\nand hence for a given conductor\n\n$$R = \\rho \\frac{l}{A}$$\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhere the constant of proportionality \u03c1 depends on the material of the conductor but not on its dimensions. \u03c1 is called resistivity.\n\nUsing the last equation, Ohm\u2019s law reads\n\n$$V = I \\times R = \\frac{I \\rho l}{A}$$\n\n(3.10)\n\nCurrent per unit area (taken normal to the current), I/A, is called current density and is denoted by j. The SI units of the current density are A/m\u00b2. Further, if E is the magnitude of uniform electric field in the conductor whose length is l, then the potential difference V across its ends is El. Using these, the last equation reads\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n84\n```\n\n```markdown\n# Current Electricity\n\n$E l = j \\rho l$\n\nor, $E = j \\rho$ (3.11)\n\nThe above relation for **magnitudes** $E$ and $j$ can indeed be cast in a **vector** form. The current density, (which we have defined as the current through unit area **normal** to the current) is also directed along $\\mathbf{E}$, and is also a vector $\\mathbf{j} (\\equiv j \\mathbf{E}/E)$. Thus, the last equation can be written as,\n\n$\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{j} \\rho$ (3.12)\n\nor, $\\mathbf{j} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}$ (3.13)\n\nwhere $\\sigma \\equiv 1/\\rho$ is called the **conductivity**. Ohm's law is often stated in an equivalent form, Eq. (3.13) in addition to Eq.(3.3). In the next section, we will try to understand the origin of the Ohm's law as arising from the characteristics of the drift of electrons.\n\n## 3.5 Drift of Electrons and the Origin of Resistivity\n\nAs remarked before, an electron will suffer collisions with the heavy fixed ions, but after collision, it will emerge with the same speed but in random directions. If we consider all the electrons, their average velocity will be zero since their directions are random. Thus, if there are $N$ electrons and the velocity of the $i^{th}$ electron $(i = 1, 2, 3, \\dots N)$ at a given time is $\\mathbf{v}_i$, then\n\n$\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{v}_i = 0$ (3.14)\n\nConsider now the situation when an electric field is present. Electrons will be accelerated due to this field by", "chapter_title": "Chapter 1: Introduction to Electric Current", "section_title": "Charge and Current", "page_start": 4, "page_end": 5}, {"text_content": "Electrons will be accelerated due to this field by\n\n$\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{-e \\mathbf{E}}{m}$ (3.15)\n\nwhere $-e$ is the charge and $m$ is the mass of an electron. Consider again the $i^{th}$ electron at a given time $t$. This electron would have had its last collision some time before $t$, and let $t_i$ be the time elapsed after its last collision. If $\\mathbf{v}_i$ was its velocity immediately after the last collision, then its velocity $\\mathbf{v}_i$ at time $t$ is\n\n$\\mathbf{v}_i = \\mathbf{v}_i + \\frac{-e \\mathbf{E}}{m} t_i$ (3.16)\n\nsince starting with its last collision it was accelerated (Fig. 3.3) with an acceleration given by Eq. (3.15) for a time interval $t_i$. The average velocity of the electrons at time $t$ is the average of all the $\\mathbf{v}_i$'s. The average of $\\mathbf{v}_i$'s is zero [Eq. (3.14)] since immediately after any collision, the direction of the velocity of an electron is completely random. The collisions of the electrons do not occur at regular intervals but at random times. Let us denote by $\\tau$, the average time between successive collisions. Then at a given time, some of the electrons would have spent\n\n[Figure 3.3: A schematic picture of an electron moving from a point A to another point B through repeated collisions, and straight line travel between collisions (full lines).

In other words, the time t_i in Eq. (3.16) will be less than \u03c4 for some and more than \u03c4 for others as we go through the values of i = 1, 2 .... N. The average value of t_i then is \u03c4 (known as relaxation time). Thus, averaging Eq. (3.16) over the N-electrons at any given time t gives us for the average velocity v_d\n\n$$\nv_d \\equiv (v_i)_{average} = (v_i)_{average} - \\frac{eE}{m} (t_i)_{average}\n$$\n\n$$\n= 0 - \\frac{eE}{m} \\tau = - \\frac{eE}{m} \\tau\n$$\n\n(3.17)\n\nThis last result is surprising. It tells us that the electrons move with an average velocity which is independent of time, although electrons are accelerated. This is the phenomenon of drift and the velocity v_d in Eq. (3.17) is called the drift velocity.\n\nBecause of the drift, there will be net transport of charges across any area perpendicular to E. Consider a planar area A, located inside the conductor such that the normal to the area is parallel to E (Fig. 3.4). Then because of the drift, in an infinitesimal amount of time \u0394t, all electrons to the left of the area at distances upto |v_d|\u0394t would have crossed the area. If n is the number of free electrons per unit volume in the metal, then there are nA|v_d|\u0394t such electrons. Since each electron carries a charge -e, the total charge transported across this area A to the right in time \u0394t is -neA|v_d|\u0394t. E is directed towards the left and hence the total charge transported along E across the area is negative of this. The amount of charge crossing the area A in time \u0394t is by definition [Eq. (3.2)] I\u0394t, where I is the magnitude of the current. Hence,\n\n$$\nI \\Delta t = + neA |v_d| \\Delta t\n$$\n\n(3.18)\n\nSubstituting the value of |v_d| from Eq. (3.17)\n\n$$\nI \\Delta t = \\frac{e^2 A \\tau n}{m} \\Delta t |E|\n$$\n\n(3.19)\n\nBy definition I is related to the magnitude |j| of the current density by\n\n$$\nI = |j|A\n$$\n\n(3.20)\n\nHence, from Eqs.(3.19) and (3.20),\n\n$$\n|j| = \\frac{ne^2 \\tau}{m} |E|\n$$\n\n(3.21)\n\nThe vector j is parallel to E and hence we can write Eq.

We have, of course, made assumptions that $\\tau$ and $n$ are constants, independent of $E$. We shall, in the next section, discuss the limitations of Ohm's law.\n\n---\n\n**Example 3.1** (a) Estimate the average drift speed of conduction electrons in a copper wire of cross-sectional area $1.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}^2$ carrying a current of 1.5 A. Assume that each copper atom contributes roughly one conduction electron. The density of copper is $9.0 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3$, and its atomic mass is 63.5 u. (b) Compare the drift speed obtained above with, (i) thermal speeds of copper atoms at ordinary temperatures, (ii) speed of propagation of electric field along the conductor which causes the drift motion.\n\n**Solution**\n\n(a) The direction of drift velocity of conduction electrons is opposite to the electric field direction, i.e., electrons drift in the direction of increasing potential. The drift speed $v_d$ is given by Eq. (3.18)\n\n$$\nv_d = \\frac{I}{neA}\n$$\n\nNow, $e = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C}$, $A = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}^2$, $I = 1.5 \\, \\text{A}$. The density of conduction electrons, $n$ is equal to the number of atoms per cubic metre (assuming one conduction electron per Cu atom as is reasonable from its valence electron count of one). A cubic metre of copper has a mass of $9.0 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{kg}$. Since $6.0 \\times 10^{23}$ copper atoms have a mass of 63.5 g,\n\n$$\nn = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{23}}{63.5} \\times 9.0 \\times 10^6 = 8.5 \\times 10^{28} \\, \\text{m}^{-3}\n$$\n\nwhich gives,\n\n$$\nv_d = \\frac{1.5}{8.5 \\times 10^{28} \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-7}} = 1.1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m s}^{-1} = 1.1 \\, \\text{mm s}^{-1}\n$$\n\n(b) (i) At a temperature $T$, the thermal speed* of a copper atom of mass $M$ is obtained from $\\langle \\frac{1}{2} Mv^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\frac{3}{2} k_B T \\rangle$ and is thus typically of the order of $\\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T}{M}}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. For copper at 300 K, this is about $2 \\times 10^2 \\, \\text{m/s}$. This figure indicates the random vibrational speeds of copper atoms in a conductor. Note that the drift speed of electrons is much smaller, about $10^{-5}$ times the typical thermal speed at ordinary temperatures.\n\n(ii) An electric field travelling along the conductor has a speed of an electromagnetic wave, namely equal to $3.0 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m s}^{-1}$ (You will learn about this in Chapter 8). The drift speed is, in comparison, extremely small; smaller by a factor of $10^{-11}$.\n\n---\n\n* See Eq. (12.23) of Chapter 12 from Class XI book.\n\n---\n\n[Reprint 2025-26]\n```\n\n```markdown\n# Physics\n\n## Example 3.2\n\n(a) In Example 3.1, the electron drift speed is estimated to be only a few mm s$^{-1}$ for currents in the range of a few amperes? How then is current established almost the instant a circuit is closed?\n\n(b) The electron drift arises due to the force experienced by electrons in the electric field inside the conductor. But force should cause acceleration. Why then do the electrons acquire a steady average drift speed?\n\n(c) If the electron drift speed is so small, and the electron's charge is small, how can we still obtain large amounts of current in a conductor?\n\n(d) When electrons drift in a metal from lower to higher potential, does it mean that all the 'free' electrons of the metal are moving in the same direction?\n\n(e) Are the paths of electrons straight lines between successive collisions (with the positive ions of the metal) in the (i) absence of electric field, (ii) presence of electric field?\n\n### Solution\n\n(e) Are the paths of electrons straight lines between successive collisions (with the positive ions of the metal) in the (i) absence of electric field, (ii) presence of electric field?\n\n### Solution\n\n(a) Electric field is established throughout the circuit, almost instantly (with the speed of light) causing at every point a local electron drift. Establishment of a current does not have to wait for electrons from one end of the conductor travelling to the other end. However, it does take a little while for the current to reach its steady value.\n\n(b) Each 'free' electron does accelerate, increasing its drift speed until it collides with a positive ion of the metal. It loses its drift speed after collision but starts to accelerate and increases its drift speed again only to suffer a collision again and so on. On the average, therefore, electrons acquire only a drift speed.\n\n(c) Simple, because the electron number density is enormous, $\\sim 10^{29}$ m$^{-3}$.\n\n(d) By no means. The drift velocity is superposed over the large random velocities of electrons.\n\n(e) In the absence of electric field, the paths are straight lines; in the presence of electric field, the paths are, in general, curved.\n\n## 3.5.1 Mobility\n\nAs we have seen, conductivity arises from mobile charge carriers. In metals, these mobile charge carriers are electrons; in an ionised gas, they are electrons and positive charged ions; in an electrolyte, these can be both positive and negative ions.\n\nAn important quantity is the mobility $\\mu$ defined as the magnitude of the drift velocity per unit electric field:\n\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{|v_d|}{E}\n$$\n\nThe SI unit of mobility is m$^2$/Vs and is $10^4$ of the mobility in practical units (cm$^2$/Vs). Mobility is positive. From Eq.

The deviations broadly are one or more of the following types:\n\n(a) $V$ ceases to be proportional to $I$ (Fig. 3.5).\n\n(b) The relation between $V$ and $I$ depends on the sign of $V$. In other words, if $I$ is the current for a certain $V$, then reversing the direction of $V$ keeping its magnitude fixed, does not produce a current of the same magnitude as $I$ in the opposite direction (Fig. 3.6). This happens, for example, in a diode which we will study in Chapter 14.\n\n(c) The relation between $V$ and $I$ is not unique, i.e., there is more than one value of $V$ for the same current $I$ (Fig. 3.7). A material exhibiting such behaviour is GaAs.\n\nMaterials and devices not obeying Ohm\u2019s law in the form of Eq. (3.3) are actually widely used in electronic circuits. In this and a few subsequent chapters, however, we will study the electrical currents in materials that obey Ohm\u2019s law.\n\n## 3.7 RESISTIVITY OF VARIOUS MATERIALS\n\nThe materials are classified as conductors, semiconductors and insulators depending on their resistivities, in an increasing order of their values.\n\n[Figure 3.5: The dashed line represents the linear Ohm\u2019s law. The solid line is the voltage $V$ versus current $I$ for a good conductor.]\n\n[Figure 3.6: Characteristic curve of a diode.

At the\nother end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics having\nresistivities 1018 times greater than metals or more. In between the two\nare the semiconductors. These, however, have resistivities\ncharacteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature. The resistivities\nof semiconductors can be decreased by adding small amount of suitable\nimpurities. This last feature is exploited in use of semiconductors for\nelectronic devices.\n3.8\nTEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF RESISTIVITY\nThe resistivity of a material is found to be dependent on the temperature.\nDifferent materials do not exhibit the same dependence on temperatures.\nOver a limited range of temperatures, that is not too large, the resistivity\nof a metallic conductor is approximately given by,\nrT = r0 [1 + a (T\u2013T0)]\n(3.26)\nwhere rT is the resistivity at a temperature T and r0 is the same at a\nreference temperature T0. a is called the temperature co-efficient of\nresistivity, and from Eq. (3.26), the dimension of a is (Temperature)\u20131.\nFor  metals, a is positive.\nThe relation of Eq. (3.26) implies that a graph of rT plotted against T\nwould be a straight line. At temperatures much lower than 0\u00b0C, the graph,\nhowever, deviates considerably from a straight line (Fig. 3.8).\nEquation (3.26) thus, can be used approximately over a limited range\nof T around any reference temperature T0, where the graph can be\napproximated as a straight line.\nFIGURE 3.8\nResistivity rT of\ncopper as a function\nof temperature T.\nFIGURE 3.9 Resistivity\nrT of nichrome as a\nfunction of absolute\ntemperature T.\nFIGURE 3.10\nTemperature dependence\nof resistivity for a typical\nsemiconductor.\n\uf072\nSome materials like Nichrome (which is an alloy of nickel, iron and\nchromium) exhibit a very weak dependence of resistivity with temperature\n(Fig. 3.9). Manganin and constantan have similar properties. These\nmaterials are thus widely used in wire bound standard resistors since\ntheir resistance values would change very little with temperatures.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n```markdown\n# Current Electricity\n\nUnlike metals, the resistivities of semiconductors decrease with increasing temperatures. A typical dependence is shown in Fig. 3.10.\n\nWe can qualitatively understand the temperature dependence of resistivity, in the light of our derivation of Eq. (3.23). From this equation, resistivity of a material is given by\n\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} = \\frac{m}{n e^2 \\tau}\n$$\n\n$\\rho$ thus depends inversely both on the number $n$ of free electrons per unit volume and on the average time $\\tau$ between collisions. As we increase temperature, average speed of the electrons, which act as the carriers of current, increases resulting in more frequent collisions. The average time of collisions $\\tau$, thus decreases with temperature.\n\nIn a metal, $n$ is not dependent on temperature to any appreciable extent and thus the decrease in the value of $\\tau$ with rise in temperature causes $\\rho$ to increase as we have observed.\n\nFor insulators and semiconductors, however, $n$ increases with temperature. This increase more than compensates any decrease in $\\tau$ in Eq.(3.23) so that for such materials, $\\rho$ decreases with temperature.\n\n### Example 3.3\n\nAn electric toaster uses nichrome for its heating element. When a negligibly small current passes through it, its resistance at room temperature (27.0 \u00b0C) is found to be 75.3 $\\Omega$. When the toaster is connected to a 230 V supply, the current settles, after a few seconds, to a steady value of 2.68 A. What is the steady temperature of the nichrome element? The temperature coefficient of resistance of nichrome averaged over the temperature range involved, is $1.70 \\times 10^{-4} \u00b0C^{-1}$.\n\n**Solution**\n\nt is the steady temperature of the nichrome element? The temperature coefficient of resistance of nichrome averaged over the temperature range involved, is $1.70 \\times 10^{-4} \u00b0C^{-1}$.\n\n**Solution**\n\nWhen the current through the element is very small, heating effects can be ignored and the temperature $T_1$ of the element is the same as room temperature. When the toaster is connected to the supply, its initial current will be slightly higher than its steady value of 2.68 A. But due to heating effect of the current, the temperature will rise. This will cause an increase in resistance and a slight decrease in current. In a few seconds, a steady state will be reached when temperature will rise no further, and both the resistance of the element and the current drawn will achieve steady values. The resistance $R_2$ at the steady temperature $T_2$ is\n\n$$\nR_2 = \\frac{230 V}{2.68 A} = 85.8 \\Omega\n$$\n\nUsing the relation\n\n$$\nR_2 = R_1 [1 + \\alpha (T_2 - T_1)]\n$$\n\nwith $\\alpha = 1.70 \\times 10^{-4} \u00b0C^{-1}$, we get\n\n$$\nT_2 - T_1 = \\frac{(85.8 - 75.3)}{(75.3) \\times 1.70 \\times 10^{-4}} = 820 \u00b0C\n$$\n\nthat is, $T_2 = (820 + 27.0) \u00b0C = 847 \u00b0C$\n\nThus, the steady temperature of the heating element (when heating effect due to the current equals heat loss to the surroundings) is 847 \u00b0C.\n\n**Example 3.3**\n\nReprint 2025-26\n```\n\n```markdown\n# Physics\n\n## Example 3.4\n\nThe resistance of the platinum wire of a platinum resistance thermometer at the ice point is $5 \\Omega$ and at steam point is $5.23 \\Omega$.

The electric potential at A and B are denoted by $V(A)$ and $V(B)$ respectively. Since current is flowing from A to B, $V(A) > V(B)$ and the potential difference across AB is $V = V(A) - V(B) > 0$.\n\nIn a time interval $\\Delta t$, an amount of charge $\\Delta Q = I \\Delta t$ travels from A to B. The potential energy of the charge at A, by definition, was $Q V(A)$ and similarly at B, it is $Q V(B)$. Thus, change in its potential energy $\\Delta U_{pot}$ is\n\n$$\n\\Delta U_{pot} = \\text{Final potential energy} - \\text{Initial potential energy}\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\Delta Q [V(B) - V(A)] = -\\Delta Q V\n$$\n\n$$\n= -I V \\Delta t < 0 \\tag{3.28}\n$$\n\nIf charges moved without collisions through the conductor, their kinetic energy would also change so that the total energy is unchanged. Conservation of total energy would then imply that,\n\n$$\n\\Delta K = -\\Delta U_{pot} \\tag{3.29}\n$$\n\nthat is,\n\n$$\n\\Delta K = I V \\Delta t > 0 \\tag{3.30}\n$$\n\nThus, in case charges were moving freely through the conductor under the action of electric field, their kinetic energy would increase as they move. We have, however, seen earlier that on the average, charge carriers do not move with acceleration but with a steady drift velocity. This is because of the collisions with ions and atoms during transit. During collisions, the energy gained by the charges thus is shared with the atoms. The atoms vibrate more vigorously, i.e., the conductor heats up. Thus, in an actual conductor, an amount of energy dissipated as heat in the conductor during the time interval $\\Delta t$ is,\n\n$$\n\\Delta W = I V \\Delta t \\tag{3.31}\n$$\n\nThe energy dissipated per unit time is the power dissipated $P = \\Delta W / \\Delta t$ and we have,\n\n$$\nP = I V \\tag{3.32}\n$$\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n[Page number 92 at the bottom right corner]\n```\n\n```markdown\n# Current Electricity\n\nUsing Ohm's law $V = IR$, we get\n\n$$P = I^2 R = \\frac{V^2}{R}$$\n\n$$\nP = I V \\tag{3.32}\n$$\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n[Page number 92 at the bottom right corner]\n```\n\n```markdown\n# Current Electricity\n\nUsing Ohm's law $V = IR$, we get\n\n$$P = I^2 R = \\frac{V^2}{R}$$\n\nas the power loss (\"ohmic loss\") in a conductor of resistance $R$ carrying a current $I$. It is this power which heats up, for example, the coil of an electric bulb to incandescence, radiating out heat and light.\n\nWhere does the power come from? As we have reasoned before, we need an external source to keep a steady current through the conductor. It is clearly this source which must supply this power. In the simple circuit shown with a cell (Fig.3.11), it is the chemical energy of the cell which supplies this power for as long as it can.\n\nThe expressions for power, Eqs. (3.32) and (3.33), show the dependence of the power dissipated in a resistor $R$ on the current through it and the voltage across it.\n\nEquation (3.33) has an important application to power transmission. Electrical power is transmitted from power stations to homes and factories, which may be hundreds of miles away, via transmission cables. One obviously wants to minimise the power loss in the transmission cables connecting the power stations to homes and factories. We shall see now how this can be achieved. Consider a device $R$, to which a power $P$ is to be delivered via transmission cables having a resistance $R_c$ to be dissipated by it finally. If $V$ is the voltage across $R$ and $I$ the current through it, then\n\n$$P = VI$$\n\nThe connecting wires from the power station to the device has a finite resistance $R_c$. The power dissipated in the connecting wires, which is wasted is $P_c$ with\n\n$$P_c = I^2 R_c = \\frac{P^2 R_c}{V^2}$$\n\nfrom Eq. (3.32). Thus, to drive a device of power $P$, the power wasted in the connecting wires is inversely proportional to $V^2$. The transmission cables from power stations are hundreds of miles long and their resistance $R_c$ is considerable. To reduce $P_c$, these wires carry current at enormous values of $V$ and this is the reason for the high voltage danger signs on transmission lines \u2014 a common sight as we move away from populated areas. Using electricity at such voltages is not safe and hence at the other end, a device called a transformer lowers the voltage to a value suitable for use.\n\n## 3.10 Cells, EMF, Internal Resistance\n\nWe have already mentioned that a simple device to maintain a steady current in an electric circuit is the electrolytic cell. Basically a cell has two electrodes, called the positive (P) and the negative (N), as shown in\n\n[Figure 3.11: Heat is produced in the resistor $R$ which is connected across the terminals of a cell. The energy dissipated in the resistor $R$ comes from the chemical energy of the electrolyte.]\n\nReprint 2025-26\n```", "chapter_title": "Chapter 3: Electric Circuits", "section_title": "Voltage and Current in Electric Circuits", "page_start": 10, "page_end": 13}, {"text_content": "The energy dissipated in the resistor $R$ comes from the chemical energy of the electrolyte.]\n\nReprint 2025-26\n```\n\nPhysics\n94\nFig. 3.12. They are immersed in an electrolytic solution. Dipped in\nthe solution, the electrodes exchange charges with the electrolyte.\nThe positive electrode has a potential difference V+ (V+ > 0) between\nitself and the electrolyte solution immediately adjacent to it marked\nA in the figure. Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negative\npotential  \u2013 (V\u2013 ) (V\u2013 \u2265 0) relative to the electrolyte adjacent to it,\nmarked as B in the figure. When there is no current, the electrolyte\nhas the same potential throughout, so that the potential difference\nbetween P and N is V+ \u2013 (\u2013V\u2013) = V+ + V\u2013 . This difference is called the\nelectromotive force (emf) of the cell and is denoted by e. Thus\ne = V++V\u2013 >  0\n(3.36)\nNote that e is, actually, a potential difference and not a force. The\nname emf, however, is used because of historical reasons, and was\ngiven at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly.\nTo understand the significance of e, consider a resistor R\nconnected across the cell (Fig. 3.12). A current I flows across R\nfrom C to D. As explained before, a steady current is maintained\nbecause current flows from N to P through the electrolyte. Clearly,\nacross the electrolyte the same current flows through the electrolyte\nbut from N to P, whereas through R, it flows from P to N.\nThe electrolyte through which a current flows has a finite\nresistance r, called the internal resistance. Consider first the\nsituation when R is infinite so that I = V/R = 0, where V is the\npotential difference between P and N. Now,\nV = Potential difference between P and A\n       + Potential difference between A and B\n       + Potential  difference between B and N\n   = e\n(3.37)\nThus, emf e is the potential difference between the positive and\nnegative electrodes in an open circuit, i.e., when no current is\nflowing through the cell.\nIf however R is finite, I is not zero. In that case the potential difference\nbetween P and N is\nV = V++ V\u2013 \u2013 I r\n   = e \u2013 I r\n(3.38)\nNote the negative sign in the expression (I r) for the potential difference\nbetween A and B. This is because the current I flows from B to A in the\nelectrolyte.\nIn  practical calculations, internal resistances of cells in the circuit\nmay be neglected when the  current I is such that e >> I r. The actual\nvalues of the internal resistances of cells vary from cell to cell. The internal\nresistance of dry cells, however, is much higher than the common\nelectrolytic cells.\nWe also observe that since V is the potential difference across R, we\nhave from Ohm\u2019s law\nV = I  R\n(3.39)\nCombining Eqs. (3.38) and (3.39), we get\nFIGURE 3.12 (a) Sketch of\nan electrolyte cell with\npositive terminal P and\nnegative terminal N. The\ngap between the electrodes\nis exaggerated for clarity.

And like resistors, one can, for calculating currents and voltages in a circuit, replace a combination of cells by an equivalent cell.\n\n[Figure 3.13: Two cells of emfs $\\varepsilon_1$ and $\\varepsilon_2$ in the series. $r_1, r_2$ are their internal resistances.

Then $V(A) - V(B)$ is the potential difference between the positive and negative terminals of the first cell. We have already calculated it in Eq. (3.38) and hence,\n\n$$V_{AB} \\equiv V(A) - V(B) = \\varepsilon_1 - I r_1$$ (3.41)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$$V_{BC} \\equiv V(B) - V(C) = \\varepsilon_2 - I r_2$$ (3.42)\n\nHence, the potential difference between the terminals A and C of the combination is\n\n$$V_{AC} \\equiv V(A) - V(C) = V(A) - V(B) + V(B) - V(C)$$\n\n$$= (\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_2) - I (r_1 + r_2)$$ (3.43)\n\nIf we wish to replace the combination by a single cell between A and C of emf $\\varepsilon_{eq}$ and internal resistance $r_{eq}$, we would have\n\n$$V_{AC} = \\varepsilon_{eq} - I r_{eq}$$ (3.44)\n\nComparing the last two equations, we get\n\n$$\\varepsilon_{eq} = \\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_2$$ (3.45)\n\nand $$r_{eq} = r_1 + r_2$$ (3.46)\n\nIn Fig. 3.13, we had connected the negative electrode of the first to the positive electrode of the second. If instead we connect the two negatives,\n\nReprint 2025-26\n```\n\n```markdown\n# Physics\n\nEq. (3.42) would change to $V_{BC} = -\\epsilon_2 - I r_2$ and we will get\n\n$$\\epsilon_{eq} = \\epsilon_1 - \\epsilon_2 \\quad (\\epsilon_1 > \\epsilon_2)$$\n\n(3.47)\n\nThe rule for series combination clearly can be extended to any number of cells:\n\n(i) The equivalent emf of a series combination of n cells is just the sum of their individual emf's, and\n\n(ii) The equivalent internal resistance of a series combination of n cells is just the sum of their internal resistances.\n\nThis is so, when the current leaves each cell from the positive electrode. If in the combination, the current leaves any cell from the negative electrode, the emf of the cell enters the expression for $\\epsilon_{eq}$ with a negative sign, as in Eq. (3.47).\n\nNext, consider a parallel combination of the cells (Fig. 3.14). $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the currents leaving the positive electrodes of the cells. At the point $B_1$, $I_1$ and $I_2$ flow in whereas the current $I$ flows out. Since as much charge flows in as out, we have\n\n$$I = I_1 + I_2$$\n\n(3.48)\n\nLet $V(B_1)$ and $V(B_2)$ be the potentials at $B_1$ and $B_2$, respectively. Then, considering the first cell, the potential difference across its terminals is $V(B_1) - V(B_2)$. Hence, from Eq. (3.38)\n\n$$V = V(B_1) - V(B_2) = \\epsilon_1 - I_1 r_1$$\n\n(3.49)\n\nPoints $B_1$ and $B_2$ are connected exactly similarly to the second cell.

The formulae we have derived earlier for series and parallel combinations of resistors are not always sufficient to determine all the currents and potential differences in the circuit. Two rules, called Kirchhoff's rules, are very useful for analysis of electric circuits.\n\nGiven a circuit, we start by labelling currents in each resistor by a symbol, say $I$, and a directed arrow to indicate that a current $I$ flows along the resistor in the direction indicated. If ultimately $I$ is determined to be positive, the actual current in the resistor is in the direction of the arrow. If $I$ turns out to be negative, the current actually flows in a direction opposite to the arrow. Similarly, for each source (i.e., cell or some other source of electrical power) the positive and negative electrodes are labelled, as well as, a directed arrow with a symbol for the current flowing through the cell. This will tell us the potential difference, $V = V(P) - V(N) = \\varepsilon - I r$ [Eq. (3.38)] between the positive terminal $P$ and the negative terminal $N$; $I$ here is the current flowing from $N$ to $P$ through the cell. If, while labelling the current $I$ through the cell one goes from $P$ to $N$, then of course\n\n$$\nV = \\varepsilon + I r \\tag{3.60}\n$$\n\nHaving clarified labelling, we now state the rules and the proof:\n\n(a) **Junction rule:** At any junction, the sum of the currents entering the junction is equal to the sum of currents leaving the junction (Fig. 3.15).\n\n[Image of Gustav Robert Kirchhoff]\n\n**Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824 - 1887)** German physicist, professor at Heidelberg and at Berlin.

In a closed\nloop, we do come back to the starting point and\nhence the rule.\nFIGURE 3.15 At junction a the current\nleaving is I1 + I2 and current entering is I3.\nThe junction rule says I3 = I1 + I2.

There is, however, a clear symmetry in the problem which we can exploit to obtain the equivalent resistance of the network. The paths AA', AD and AB are obviously symmetrically placed in the network. Thus, the current in each must be the same, say, I. Further, at the corners A', B and D, the incoming current I must split equally into the two outgoing branches. In this manner, the current in all the 12 edges of the cube are easily written down in terms of I, using Kirchhoff's first rule and the symmetry in the problem. Next take a closed loop, say, ABCCEA, and apply Kirchhoff's second rule:\n\n$$-IR - (1/2)IR - IR + \\varepsilon = 0$$\n\nwhere R is the resistance of each edge and $\\varepsilon$ the emf of battery. Thus,\n\n$$\\varepsilon = \\frac{5}{2}IR$$\n\nThe equivalent resistance $R_{eq}$ of the network is\n\n$$R_{eq} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{3I} = \\frac{5}{6}R$$\n\nFor $R = 1 \\Omega$, $R_{eq} = (5/6) \\Omega$ and for $\\varepsilon = 10 V$, the total current (= 3I) in the network is\n\n$$3I = 10 V / (5/6) \\Omega = 12 A, i.e., I = 4 A$$\n\nThe current flowing in each edge can now be read off from the Fig. 3.16.\n\nIt should be noted that because of the symmetry of the network, the great power of Kirchhoff's rules has not been very apparent in Example 3.5. In a general network, there will be no such simplification due to symmetry, and only by application of Kirchhoff's rules to junctions and closed loops (as many as necessary to solve the unknowns in the network) can we handle the problem. This will be illustrated in Example 3.6.\n\n**Example 3.6** Determine the current in each branch of the network shown in Fig. 3.17.\n\n[Diagram of a circuit with resistors and voltage sources labeled with currents and resistances]\n\n**FIGURE 3.17**\n\nReprint 2025-26\n```\n\n```markdown\n# Physics\n\n## Solution\n\n3.17.\n\n[Diagram of a circuit with resistors and voltage sources labeled with currents and resistances]\n\n**FIGURE 3.17**\n\nReprint 2025-26\n```\n\n```markdown\n# Physics\n\n## Solution\n\nEach branch of the network is assigned an unknown current to be determined by the application of Kirchhoff's rules.

These can be solved by the usual method to give\n\n$$\nI_1 = 2.5A, \\quad I_2 = \\frac{5}{8}A, \\quad I_3 = \\frac{7}{8}A\n$$\n\nThe currents in the various branches of the network are\n\n| AB | $\\frac{5}{8}$ A |\n|----|----------------|\n| CA | $\\frac{1}{2}$ A |\n| DEB | $\\frac{7}{8}$ A |\n| AD | $\\frac{7}{8}$ A |\n| CD | 0 A |\n| BC | $\\frac{1}{2}$ A |\n\nIt is easily verified that Kirchhoff's second rule applied to the remaining closed loops does not provide any additional independent equation, that is, the above values of currents satisfy the second rule for every closed loop of the network. For example, the total voltage drop over the closed loop BADEB\n\n$$\n5V + \\left(\\frac{5}{8} \\times 4\\right)V - \\left(\\frac{15}{8} \\times 4\\right)V\n$$\n\nequal to zero, as required by Kirchhoff's second rule.\n\n## 3.13 Wheatstone Bridge\n\nAs an application of Kirchhoff's rules consider the circuit shown in Fig. 3.18, which is called the Wheatstone bridge. The bridge has four resistors $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$ and $R_4$. Across one pair of diagonally opposite points (A and C in the figure) a source is connected. This (i.e., AC) is called the battery arm. Between the other two vertices, B and D, a galvanometer G (which is a device to detect currents) is connected. This line, shown as BD in the figure, is called the galvanometer arm.\n\nFor simplicity, we assume that the cell has no internal resistance. In general there will be currents flowing across all the resistors as well as a current $I_g$ through G. Of special interest, is the case of a balanced bridge where the resistors are such that $I_g = 0$. We can easily get the balance condition, such that there is no current through G. In this case, the Kirchhoff's junction rule applied to junctions D and B (see the figure)\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n[Example 3.6]\n\n[Figure 3.18: Wheatstone Bridge Circuit]\n```\n\n```markdown\n# Current Electricity\n\nimmediately gives us the relations $I_1 = I_3$ and $I_2 = I_4$. Next, we apply Kirchhoff's loop rule to closed loops ADBA and CBDC. The first loop gives\n\n$$-I_1 R_1 + 0 + I_2 R_2 = 0 \\quad (I_g = 0)$$\n\nand the second loop gives, upon using $I_3 = I_1, I_4 = I_2$\n\n$$I_2 R_4 + 0 - I_1 R_3 = 0$$\n\nFrom Eq. (3.62), we obtain,\n\n$$\\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \\frac{R_2}{R_1}$$\n\nwhereas from Eq. (3.63), we obtain,\n\n$$\\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \\frac{R_4}{R_3}$$\n\nHence, we obtain the condition\n\n$$\\frac{R_2}{R_1} = \\frac{R_4}{R_3}$$\n\nThis last equation relating the four resistors is called the **balance condition** for the galvanometer to give zero or null deflection.\n\nwe obtain the condition\n\n$$\\frac{R_2}{R_1} = \\frac{R_4}{R_3}$$\n\nThis last equation relating the four resistors is called the **balance condition** for the galvanometer to give zero or null deflection.\n\nThe Wheatstone bridge and its balance condition provide a practical method for determination of an unknown resistance. Let us suppose we have an unknown resistance, which we insert in the fourth arm; $R_4$ is thus not known. Keeping known resistances $R_1$ and $R_2$ in the first and second arm of the bridge, we go on varying $R_3$ till the galvanometer shows a null deflection. The bridge then is balanced, and from the balance condition the value of the unknown resistance $R_4$ is given by,\n\n$$R_4 = R_3 \\frac{R_2}{R_1}$$\n\nA practical device using this principle is called the **meter bridge**.\n\n[Diagram: Wheatstone bridge circuit with resistors $R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4$ and a galvanometer]\n\n**Example 3.7** The four arms of a Wheatstone bridge (Fig. 3.19) have the following resistances:\n- AB = 100$\\Omega$\n- BC = 10$\\Omega$\n- CD = 5$\\Omega$\n- DA = 60$\\Omega$\n\n[Diagram: Wheatstone bridge circuit with specific resistances and a 10V power source]\n\n**FIGURE 3.18**\n\n**FIGURE 3.19**\n\n**EXAMPLE 3.7**\n\nReprint 2025-26\n```\n\nPhysics\n102\n EXAMPLE 3.7\n A galvanometer of 15W resistance is connected across BD.

The work done per unit charge by the source in taking the\ncharge from lower to higher potential energy (i.e., from one terminal\nof the source to the other) is called the electromotive force, or emf, of\nthe source. Note that the emf is not a force; it is the voltage difference\nbetween the two terminals of a source in open circuit.\n3.\nOhm\u2019s law: The electric current I flowing through a substance is\nproportional to the voltage V across its ends, i.e., V \u00b5 I or V = RI,\nwhere R is called the resistance of the substance.

Insulators like glass and rubber have $10^{22}$ to $10^{24}$ times greater resistivity. Semiconductors like Si and Ge lie roughly in the middle range of resistivity on a logarithmic scale.\n\n6. In most substances, the carriers of current are electrons; in some cases, for example, ionic crystals and electrolytic liquids, positive and negative ions carry the electric current.\n\n7. **Current density** $\\mathbf{j}$ gives the amount of charge flowing per second per unit area normal to the flow.\n\n$$\\mathbf{j} = nq \\mathbf{v}_d$$", "chapter_title": "Chapter 3: Electric Circuits", "section_title": "Balance Condition for Galvanometer", "page_start": 18, "page_end": 23}, {"text_content": "**Current density** $\\mathbf{j}$ gives the amount of charge flowing per second per unit area normal to the flow.\n\n$$\\mathbf{j} = nq \\mathbf{v}_d$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the number density (number per unit volume) of charge carriers each of charge $q$, and $\\mathbf{v}_d$ is the **drift velocity** of the charge carriers.
