After  studying  this  Unit,  you  will  be able  to

- define the average and instantaneous rate of  a  reaction;
- express  the  rate  of  a  reaction  in terms of  change  in  concentration of either of the reactants or products with time;
- distinguish  between  elementary and complex reactions;
- differentiate between the molecularity and order of a reaction;
- define  rate  constant;
- discuss the dependence of rate of reactions on concentration, temperature and catalyst;
- derive  integrated  rate  equations for the zero and first order reactions;
- determine  the  rate  constants  for zeroth  and  first  order  reactions;
- describe  collision  theory.

Chemical Kinetics helps us to understand how chemical reactions occur.

Chemistry, by its very nature, is concerned with change. Substances with well defined properties are converted by  chemical  reactions  into  other  substances  with different properties. For any chemical reaction, chemists try to find out

- (a) the feasibility of a chemical reaction which can be predicted by thermodynamics ( as you know that a reaction with ∆ G &lt; 0, at constant temperature and pressure is feasible);
- (b) extent  to  which  a  reaction  will  proceed  can  be determined from chemical equilibrium;
- (c) speed of a reaction i.e. time taken by a reaction to reach equilibrium.

Along  with  feasibility  and  extent,  it  is  equally important to know the rate and the factors controlling the  rate  of  a  chemical  reaction  for  its  complete understanding.  For  example,  which  parameters determine as to how rapidly food gets spoiled? How to design a rapidly setting material for dental filling? Or what controls the rate at which fuel burns in an auto engine? All these questions can be answered by the branch of chemistry, which deals with the study of  reaction  rates  and  their  mechanisms,  called chemical kinetics . The word kinetics is derived from the Greek word  'kinesis'  meaning  movement. Thermodynamics tells only about the feasibility of a reaction whereas chemical kinetics tells about the rate of  a  reaction.    For  example,  thermodynamic  data indicate that diamond shall convert to graphite but in reality the conversion rate is so slow that the change is not perceptible at all. Therefore, most people think

that diamond is forever. Kinetic studies not only help us to determine the  speed  or  rate  of  a  chemical  reaction  but  also  describe  the conditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. The factors such as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the rate  of  a  reaction.  At  the  macroscopic  level,  we  are  interested  in amounts reacted or formed and the rates of their consumption or formation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving orientation  and  energy  of  molecules  undergoing  collision
