At the other end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics having resistivities \\( 10^{18} \\) times greater than metals or more. In between the two are the semiconductors. These, however, have resistivities characteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature. The resistivities of semiconductors can be decreased by adding small amount of suitable impurities. This last feature is exploited in use of semiconductors for electronic devices.\n\n**3.8 Temperature Dependence of Resistivity**\n\nThe resistivity of a material is found to be dependent on the temperature. Different materials do not exhibit the same dependence on temperatures. Over a limited range of temperatures, that is not too large, the resistivity of a metallic conductor is approximately given by,\n\n\\[\n\\rho_T = \\rho_0 \\left[ 1 + \\alpha (T - T_0) \\right]\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\rho_T \\) is the resistivity at a temperature \\( T \\) and \\( \\rho_0 \\) is the same at a reference temperature \\( T_0 \\). \\( \\alpha \\) is called the *temperature co-efficient of resistivity*, and from Eq. (3.26), the dimension of \\( \\alpha \\) is (Temperature)\\(^{-1}\\). For metals, \\( \\alpha \\) is positive.\n\nThe relation of Eq. (3.26) implies that a graph of \\( \\rho_T \\) plotted against \\( T \\) would be a straight line. At temperatures much lower than \\( 0^\\circ C \\), the graph, however, deviates considerably from a straight line (Fig. 3.8).\n\nEquation (3.26) thus, can be used approximately over a limited range of \\( T \\) around any reference temperature \\( T_0 \\), where the graph can be approximated as a straight line.\n\n![Resistivity \u03c1_T of copper as a function of temperature T.](https://i.imgur.com/1.png)\n\n**FIGURE 3.8**\nResistivity \\( \\rho_T \\) of copper as a function of temperature \\( T \\).\n\n![Resistivity \u03c1_T of nichrome as a function of absolute temperature T.](https://i.imgur.com/2.png)\n\n**FIGURE 3.9**\nResistivity \\( \\rho_T \\) of nichrome as a function of absolute temperature \\( T \\).\n\n![Temperature dependence of resistivity for a typical semiconductor.](https://i.imgur.com/3.png)\n\n**FIGURE 3.10**\nTemperature dependence of resistivity for a typical semiconductor.\n\nSome materials like Nichrome (which is an alloy of nickel, iron and chromium) exhibit a very weak dependence of resistivity with temperature (Fig. 3.9).

Hence, reactions with the molecularity three are very rare and slow to proceed.\n\nIt is, therefore, evident that complex reactions involving more than three molecules in the stoichiometric equation must take place in more than one step.\n\nKClO\u2083 + 6FeSO\u2084 + 3H\u2082SO\u2084 \u2192 KCl + 3Fe\u2082(SO\u2084)\u2083 + 3H\u2082O\n\nThis reaction which apparently seems to be of tenth order is actually a second order reaction. This shows that this reaction takes place in several steps. Which step controls the rate of the overall reaction? The question can be answered if we go through the mechanism of reaction, for example, chances to win the relay race competition by a team depend upon the slowest person in the team. Similarly, the overall rate of the reaction is controlled by the slowest step in a reaction called the **rate determining step**. Consider the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide which is catalysed by iodide ion in an alkaline medium.\n\n\\[\n2\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}_2 \\xrightarrow{\\text{Alkaline medium}} \\mathrm{I}^- \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} + \\mathrm{O}_2\n\\]\n\nThe rate equation for this reaction is found to be\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}_2]}{\\mathrm{dt}} = k[\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}_2][\\mathrm{I}^-]\n\\]\n\nThis reaction is first order with respect to both H\u2082O\u2082 and I\u207b. Evidences suggest that this reaction takes place in two steps\n\n(1) H\u2082O\u2082 + I\u207b \u2192 H\u2082O + IO\u207b\n(2) H\u2082O\u2082 + IO\u207b \u2192 H\u2082O + I\u207b + O\u2082\n\nBoth the steps are bimolecular elementary reactions. Species IO\u207b is called as an intermediate since it is formed during the course of the reaction but not in the overall balanced equation. The first step, being slow, is the rate determining step. Thus, the rate of formation of intermediate will determine the rate of this reaction.\n\nThus, from the discussion, till now, we conclude the following:\n\n(i) Order of a reaction is an experimental quantity. It can be zero and even a fraction but molecularity cannot be zero or a non integer.\n(ii) Order is applicable to elementary as well as complex reactions whereas molecularity is applicable only for elementary reactions.

We say \u2018I jumped out of the way of the bus reflexly\u2019, or \u2018I pulled my hand back from the flame reflexly\u2019, or \u2018I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly\u2019. What exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that we do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control of our reactions. Yet these are situations where we are responding with some action to changes in our environment. How is control and coordination achieved in such situations?\n\nLet us consider this further. Take one of our examples. Touching a flame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any animal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to think consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt, and therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long will it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think. If nerve impulses are sent around the way we have talked about earlier, then thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses. Thinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated interaction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.\n\nIf this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our body consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits in the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the body which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in order to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull must be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body. Similarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves must carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is to be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to get burnt!\n\nHow does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than having to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat were to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way, the process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by an output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is commonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc connections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve? The best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet each other. Nerves from all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal cord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord itself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.\n\nOf course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking process of the brain is not fast enough. In fact many animals have very little or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is quite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning in the absence of true thought processes. However, even after complex neuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be more efficient for quick responses.",

However, certain sensations are distinct from seeing or hearing, for example, how do we know that we have eaten enough? The sensation of feeling full is because of a centre associated with hunger, which is in a separate part of the fore-brain.\n\n![Diagram of human brain showing labeled parts: Fore-Brain, Cerebrum, Cranium (skull), Mid-brain, Hypothalamus, Pituitary gland, Hind-brain (Pons, Medulla, Cerebellum), Spinal cord](https://i.imgur.com/3Q5z5QG.png)\n\nFigure 6.3 Human brain\n\nStudy the labelled diagram of the human brain. We have seen that the different parts have specific functions. Can we find out the function of each part?\n\nLet us look at the other use of the word 'reflex' that we have talked about in the introduction. Our mouth waters when we see food we like without our meaning to. Our hearts beat without our thinking about it. In fact, we cannot control these actions easily by thinking about them even if we wanted to. Do we have to think about or remember to breathe or digest food? So, in between the simple reflex actions like change in the size of the pupil, and the thought out actions such as moving a chair, there is another set of muscle movements over which we do not have any thinking control. Many of these involuntary actions are controlled by the mid-brain and hind-brain. All these involuntary actions including blood pressure, salivation and vomiting are controlled by the medulla in the hind-brain.\n\nThink about activities like walking in a straight line, riding a bicycle, picking up a pencil. These are possible due to a part of the hind-brain called the cerebellum. It is responsible for precision of voluntary actions and maintaining the posture and balance of the body. Imagine what would happen if each of these events failed to take place if we were not thinking about it.",

Thinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated interaction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.\n\nIf this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our body consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits in the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the body which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in order to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull must be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body. Similarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves must carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is to be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to get burnt!\n\nHow does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than having to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat were to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way, the process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by an output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is commonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc connections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve? The best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet each other. Nerves from all over the body meet in a",
