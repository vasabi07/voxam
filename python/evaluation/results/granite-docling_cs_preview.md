'Even though most people won't be directly involved with programming, everyone is affected by computers, so an educated person should have a good understanding of how computer hardware, software, and networks operate.'

## 6.1 IntroductIon

We store many things in our home and find them out  later  as  and  when  required.  Sometimes  we remember the exact location of a required item. But,  sometimes  we  do  not  remember  the  exact location and in that case we need to search for the required item. A computer also stores lots of data to be retrieved later as and when demanded by a user or a program.

Searching means locating a particular element in a collection of elements. Search result determines  whether  that  particular  element  is present in the collection or not. If it is present, we can also find out the position of that element in the given collection. Searching is an important technique in computer science. In order to design algorithms, programmers need to understand the different ways in which a collection of data can be searched for retrieval.

## Activity 6.1

Consider a list of 15 elements:

L=[2,3,9,7,-

6,11,12,17,45,23,29,

31,-37,41,43].

Determine the number of comparisons linear search makes to search for key = 12.

## 6.2 LInear Search

Linear search is the most fundamental and the simplest search method. It is an exhaustive searching technique where every  element  of  a  given  list  is  compared  with the  item  to  be  searched  (usually  referred  to  as  'key'). So,  each  element  in  the  list  is  compared  one  by  one with the key. This process continues until an element matching  the  key  is  found  and  we  declare  that  the search is successful. If no element matches the key and we have traversed the entire list, we declare the search is unsuccessful i.e., the key is not present in the list. This item by item comparison is done in the order, in which the elements are present in the list, beginning at the first element of the list and moving towards the last. Thus, it is also called sequential search or serial search. This technique is useful for collection of items that are small in size and are unordered.

Given a list numList of n elements and key value K, Algorithm 6.1 uses a linear search algorithm to find the position of the key K in numList .

## Algorithm 6.1 : Linear Search

LinearSearch(numList, key, n) Step 1: SET index = 0 Step 2: WHILE  index &lt; n, REPEAT Step 3 Step 3: IF numlist[index]= key THEN PRINT 'Element found at position', index+1 STOP ELSE index = index+1

Step 4: PRINT 'Search unsuccessful'

Example 6.1 Assume that the numList has seven elements [8, -4, 7, 17, 0, 2, 19] so, n = 7. We need to search for the key, say 17 in numList. Table 6.1 shows the elements in the given list along with their index values.
