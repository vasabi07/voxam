Chemical Kinetics
Objectives
After studying this Unit, you will be
able to
• define the average and
instantaneous rate of a reaction:
• express the rate of a reaction in
terms of change in concentration
of either of the reactants
products with time;
Chemical Kinetics helps us to understand how chemical reactions
occur.
• distinguish between elementary
and complex reactions;
• differentiate between the
molecularity and order of
reaction;
a
• define rate constant;
• discuss the dependence of rate of
reactions on concentration,
temperature and catalyst;
derive integrated rate equations
for the zero and first order
reactions;
• determine the rate constants for
zeroth and first order reactions;
• describe collision theory.

Chemistry, by its very nature, is concerned with change.
Substances with well defined properties are converted
by chemical reactions into other substances with
different properties. For any chemical reaction, chemists
try to find out
(a) the feasibility of a chemical reaction which can be
predicted by thermodynamics ( as you know that a
reaction with $\Delta G$ < 0, at constant temperature and
pressure is feasible);
(b) extent to which a reaction will proceed can be
determined from chemical equilibrium;
(c) speed of a reaction i.e. time taken by a reaction to
reach equilibrium.
Along with feasibility and extent, it is equally
important to know the rate and the factors controlling
the rate of a chemical reaction for its complete
understanding. For example, which parameters
determine as to how rapidly food gets spoiled? How
to design a rapidly setting material for dental filling?
Or what controls the rate at which fuel burns in an
auto engine? All these questions can be answered by
the branch of chemistry, which deals with the study
of reaction rates and their mechanisms, called
chemical kinetics. The word kinetics is derived from
the Greek word 'kinesis' meaning movement.
Thermodynamics tells only about the feasibility of a
reaction whereas chemical kinetics tells about the rate
of a reaction. For example, thermodynamic data
indicate that diamond shall convert to graphite but
in reality the conversion rate is so slow that the change
is not perceptible at all. Therefore, most people think

that diamond is forever. Kinetic studies not only help us to determine
the speed or rate of a chemical reaction but also describe the
conditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. The factors
such as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the
rate of a reaction. At the macroscopic level, we are interested in
amounts reacted or formed and the rates of their consumption or
formation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving
orientation and energy of molecules undergoing collisions,
are discussed.
In this Unit, we shall be dealing with average and instantaneous
rate of reaction and the factors affecting these. Some elementary
ideas about the collision theory of reaction rates are also given.
However, in order to understand all these, let us first learn about the
reaction rate.
Some reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example,
precipitation of silver chloride occurs instantaneously by mixing of
aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride. On the other
hand, some reactions are very slow, for example, rusting of iron in
the presence of air and moisture. Also there are reactions like inversion
of cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate
speed. Can you think of more examples from each category?
You must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in
terms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain
period of time. Similarly, the speed of a reaction or the rate of a
reaction can be defined as the change in concentration of a reactant
or product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in
terms of:
(i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the
decrease in
reactants, or
(ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products.
Consider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the
system remains constant.
$R \longrightarrow P$
One mole of the reactant R produces one mole of the product P. If
$[R]_1$ and $[P]_1$ are the concentrations of R and P respectively at time $t_1$
and $[R]_2$ and $[P]_2$ are their concentrations at time $t_2$ then,

$ \Delta t = t_2 - t_1 $
$ \Delta [R] = [R]_2 - [R]_1 $
$ \Delta [P] = [P]_2 - [P]_1 $
The square brackets in the above expressions are used to express
molar concentration.
Rate of disappearance of R

$ \frac{\text{Decrease in concentration of R}}{\text{Time taken}} = -\frac{[R]}{t} $ (3.1)
