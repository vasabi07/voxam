Since the\npotential difference across the ends of the half-slabs is V,\ni.e., the same as across the full slab, the resistance of each\nof the half-slabs $R_1$ is\n$R_1 = \\frac{V}{(I/2)} = 2\\frac{V}{I} = 2R.$\n(3.6)\nThus, halving the area of the cross-section of a conductor doubles\nthe resistance. In general, then the resistance $R$ is inversely proportional\nto the cross-sectional area,\n\n$R \\propto \\frac{1}{A}$\n(3.7)\nCombining Eqs.

An ampere is defined through magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following chapter. An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in domestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the order of tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in our nerves are in microamperes.\n\n## 3.3 Electric Currents in Conductors\n\nAn electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is applied. If it is free to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free charged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the *ionosphere*. However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and are thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a gram of water, for example, contains approximately $10^{22}$ molecules. These molecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached to individual nuclei. In some materials, the electrons will still be bound, i.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied. In other materials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move within the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors, develop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied.\n\nIf we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly bound to each other so that the current is carried by the negatively charged electrons. There are, however, other types of conductors like electrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move. In our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the current is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background of fixed positive ions.\n\nConsider first the case when no electric field is present. The electrons will be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with the fixed ions. An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speed as before the collision. However, the direction of its velocity after the collision is completely random. At a given time, there is no preferential direction for the velocities of the electrons. Thus on the average, the\n\n![Page 82](https://example.com/page82)\n\nReprint 2025-26\n```",

Ohm was led to his law by an analogy between the conduction of heat: the electric field is analogous to the temperature gradient, and the electric current is analogous to the heat flow.][Image of Georg Simon Ohm]\n\nidentical to the first and the same current I flows through both. The potential difference across the ends of the combination is clearly sum of the potential difference across the two individual slabs and hence equals 2V. The current through the combination is I and the resistance of the combination R_C is [from Eq. (3.3)],\n\n$$R_C = \\frac{2V}{I} = 2R$$\n\n(3.4)\n\nsince V/I = R, the resistance of either of the slabs. Thus, doubling the length of a conductor doubles the resistance. In general, then resistance is proportional to length,\n\n$$R \\propto l$$\n\n(3.5)\n\nNext, imagine dividing the slab into two by cutting it lengthwise so that the slab can be considered as a combination of two identical slabs of length l, but each having a cross sectional area of A/2 [Fig. 3.2(c)].\n\nFor a given voltage V across the slab, if I is the current through the entire slab, then clearly the current flowing through each of the two half-slabs is I/2. Since the potential difference across the ends of the half-slabs is V, i.e., the same as across the full slab, the resistance of each of the half-slabs R_1 is\n\n$$R_1 = \\frac{V}{(I/2)} = 2\\frac{V}{I} = 2R$$\n\n(3.6)\n\nThus, halving the area of the cross-section of a conductor doubles the resistance. In general, then the resistance R is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area,\n\n$$R \\propto \\frac{1}{A}$$\n\n(3.7)\n\nCombining Eqs. (3.5) and (3.7), we have\n\n$$R \\propto \\frac{l}{A}$$\n\n(3.8)\n\nand hence for a given conductor\n\n$$R = \\rho \\frac{l}{A}$$\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhere the constant of proportionality \u03c1 depends on the material of the conductor but not on its dimensions. \u03c1 is called resistivity.\n\nUsing the last equation, Ohm's law reads\n\n$$V = I \\times R = \\frac{I \\rho l}{A}$$\n\n(3.10)\n\nCurrent per unit area (taken normal to the current), I/A, is called current density and is denoted by j. The SI units of the current density are A/m\u00b2. Further, if E is the magnitude of uniform electric field in the conductor whose length is l, then the potential difference V across its ends is El. Using these, the last equation reads\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n84\n```",
