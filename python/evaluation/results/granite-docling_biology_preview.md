I n the previous chapter, we looked at life processes involved in the maintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with a notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of these movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed germinates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the course of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth were  to  be  stopped,  these  movements  would  not  happen.  Some movements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected with  growth.  A  cat  running,  children  playing  on  swings,  buffaloes chewing cud - these are not movements caused by growth.

Why do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible answer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the environment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has seen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt by  living  organisms  to  use  changes  in  their  environment  to  their advantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure and fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough food so as to be able to digest it better. When bright light is focussed on our eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond to it with movement in order to protect ourselves.

If we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this movement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each kind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement in response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper, rather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends on the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement must be  connected  to  the  recognition  of  various  events  in  the environment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other words,  living  organisms  must  use  systems  providing  control  and coordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation in multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these control and coordination activities.

In animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and muscular tissues, which we have studied in Class IX. Touching a hot

object  is  an  urgent  and  dangerous situation for us. We need to detect it, and respond to it. How do we detect that we  are  touching  a  hot  object?  All information  from  our  environment  is detected by the specialised tips of some nerve cells. These receptors are usually located in our sense organs, such as the inner ear, the nose, the tongue, and so on. So gustatory receptors will detect taste while olfactory receptors will detect smell.

This  information,  acquired  at  the end of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell [Fig. 6.1 (a)], sets
