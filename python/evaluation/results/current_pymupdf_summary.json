Sometimes we \nremember the exact location of a required item. \nBut, sometimes we do not remember the exact \nlocation and in that case we need to search for \nthe required item. A computer also stores lots of \ndata to be retrieved later as and when demanded \nby a user or a program.\nSearching \nmeans \nlocating \na \nparticular \nelement in a collection of elements. Search result \ndetermines whether that particular element is \npresent in the collection or not. If it is present, \nwe can also find out the position of that element \nin the given collection. Searching is an important \ntechnique in computer science. In order to design \nalgorithms, programmers need to understand the \ndifferent ways in which a collection of data can be \nsearched for retrieval.\n6 \nSearching\n\u201cEven though most people won't be directly \ninvolved with programming, everyone is affected \nby computers, so an educated person should have \na good understanding of how computer hardware, \nsoftware, and networks operate.\u201d\n\u2014 Brian Kernighan\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n[PAGE 2]\nComputer Science - Class XII\n82\n6.2 Linear Search\nLinear search is the most fundamental and the simplest \nsearch method. It is an exhaustive searching technique \nwhere every element of a given list is compared with \nthe item to be searched (usually referred to as \u2018key\u2019). \nSo, each element in the list is compared one by one \nwith the key. This process continues until an element \nmatching the key is found and we declare that the \nsearch is successful. If no element matches the key and \nwe have traversed the entire list, we declare the search \nis unsuccessful i.e., the key is not present in the list. \nThis item by item comparison is done in the order, in \nwhich the elements are present in the list, beginning at \nthe first element of the list and moving towards the last. \nThus, it is also called sequential search or serial search. \nThis technique is useful for collection of items that are \nsmall in size and are unordered.\nGiven a list numList of n elements and key value K, \nAlgorithm 6.1 uses a linear search algorithm to find the \nposition of the key K in numList.\nAlgorithm 6.1 : Linear Search\nLinearSearch(numList, key, n)\nStep 1: SET index = 0\nStep 2: WHILE  index < n, REPEAT Step 3\nStep 3: IF numlist[index]= key THEN\n        PRINT \u201cElement found at position\u201d, index+1\n        STOP\n   ELSE\n        index = index+1\nStep 4: PRINT \u201cSearch unsuccessful\u201d\nExample 6.1\t Assume that the numList has seven elements \n[8, -4, 7, 17, 0, 2, 19] so, n = 7. We need to search for the key, \nsay 17 in numList.

Yes\n1\nFrom Table 6.4, it is clear that the algorithm had \nto make only 1 comparison to display \u2018Element found \nat position 1\u2019. Thus, if the key to be searched is the \nfirst element in the list, the linear search algorithm \nwill always have to make only 1 comparison. This is \nthe minimum amount of work that the linear search \nalgorithm would have to do.\nLet us now assume another arrangement of the \nelements in numList as [8, -4, 7, 0, 2, 19, 17] and search \nfor the key K =17 in numList.\nOn a dry run, we can find out that the linear search \nalgorithm has to compare each element in the list till \nthe end to display \u2018Element found at position 7\u2019. Thus, \nif the key to be searched is the last element in the \nlist, the linear search algorithm will have to make n \ncomparisons, where n is the number of elements in the \nlist.

Such currents occur\nnaturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in\nwhich charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere,\nsometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not\nsteady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow\nin a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a\ncell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we\nshall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.\n3.2  ELECTRIC CURRENT\nImagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both\nthe positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward\nacross the area. In a given time interval t, let q+ be the net amount (i.e.,\nforward minus backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward\ndirection across the area. Similarly, let q\u2013 be the net amount of negative\ncharge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount\nof charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time\ninterval t, then, is q = q+\u2013 q\u2013. This is proportional to t for steady current\nChapter Three\nCURRENT\nELECTRICITY\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n[PAGE 2]\nPhysics\n82\nand the quotient\nq\nI\nt\n=\n(3.1)\nis defined to be the current across the area in the forward direction. (If it\nturn out to be a negative number, it implies a current in the backward\ndirection.)\nCurrents are not always steady and hence more generally, we define\nthe current as follows. Let DQ be the net charge flowing across a cross-\nsection of a conductor during the time interval Dt [i.e., between times t\nand (t + Dt)]. Then, the current at time t across the cross-section of the\nconductor is defined as the value of the ratio of DQ to Dt in the limit of Dt\ntending to zero,\n( )\n0\nlim\nt\nQ\nI t\nt\n\u2206\u2192\n\u2206\n\u2261\n\u2206\n(3.2)\nIn SI units, the unit of current is ampere. An ampere is defined\nthrough magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following\nchapter. An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in\ndomestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the order\nof tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in\nour nerves are in microamperes.\n3.3 ELECTRIC CURRENTS IN CONDUCTORS\nAn electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is applied. If it is\nfree to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free\ncharged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the\nionosphere. However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged\nelectrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and\nare thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a\ngram of water, for example, contains approximately 1022 molecules. These\nmolecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached\nto individual nuclei. In some materials, the electrons will still be bound,\ni.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied. In other\nmaterials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move\nwithin the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors,\ndevelop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied.\nIf we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly\nbound to each other so that the current is carried by the negatively\ncharged electrons. There are, however, other types of conductors like\nelectrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move.\nIn our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the\ncurrent is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background\nof fixed positive ions.\nConsider first the case when no electric field is present. The electrons\nwill be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with the\nfixed ions. An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speed\nas before the collision. However, the direction of its velocity after the\ncollision is completely random. At a given time, there is no preferential\ndirection for the velocities of the electrons. Thus on the average, the\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n[PAGE 3]\nCurrent\nElectricity\n83\nnumber of electrons travelling in any direction will be equal to the number\nof electrons travelling in the opposite direction. So, there will be no net\nelectric current.\nLet us now see what happens to such a\npiece of conductor if an electric field is applied.\nTo focus our thoughts, imagine the conductor\nin the shape of a cylinder of radius R (Fig. 3.1).\nSuppose we now take two thin circular discs\nof a dielectric of the same radius and put\npositive charge +Q distributed over one disc\nand similarly \u2013Q at the other disc. We attach\nthe two discs on the two flat surfaces of the\ncylinder. An electric field will be created and\nis directed from the positive towards the\nnegative charge. The electrons will",

For example, which parameters\ndetermine as to how rapidly food gets spoiled? How\nto design a rapidly setting material for dental filling?\nOr what controls the rate at which fuel burns in an\nauto engine? All these questions can be answered by\nthe branch of chemistry, which deals with the study\nof reaction rates and their mechanisms, called\nchemical kinetics. The word kinetics is derived from\nthe Greek word \u2018kinesis\u2019 meaning movement.\nThermodynamics tells only about the feasibility of a\nreaction whereas chemical kinetics tells about the rate\nof a reaction.

Kinetic studies not only help us to determine\nthe speed or rate of a chemical reaction but also describe the\nconditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. The factors\nsuch as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the\nrate of a reaction. At the macroscopic level, we are interested in\namounts reacted or formed and the rates of their consumption or\nformation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving\norientation and energy of molecules undergoing collisions,\nare discussed.\nIn this Unit, we shall be dealing with average and instantaneous\nrate of reaction and the factors affecting these. Some elementary\nideas about the collision theory of reaction rates are also given.\nHowever, in order to understand all these, let us first learn about the\nreaction rate.\nSome reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example,\nprecipitation of silver chloride occurs instantaneously by mixing of\naqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride. On the other\nhand, some reactions are very slow, for example, rusting of iron in\nthe presence of air and moisture. Also there are reactions like inversion\nof cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate\nspeed. Can you think of more examples from each category?\nYou must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in\nterms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain\nperiod of time. Similarly, the speed of  a reaction or  the rate of a\nreaction can be defined as the change in concentration of  a reactant\nor product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in\nterms of:\n(i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the\nreactants, or\n(ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products.\nConsider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the\nsystem remains constant.\nR \u00ae P\nOne mole of the reactant R produces one mole of the product P.

There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud \u2013 these are not movements caused by growth.\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better. When bright light is focussed on\nour eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond\nto it with movement in order to protect ourselves.\nIf we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this\nmovement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each\nkind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement\nin response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper,\nrather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends\non the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement\nmust be connected to the recognition of various events in the\nenvironment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other\nwords, living organisms must use systems providing control and\ncoordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation\nin multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these\ncontrol and coordination activities.\n6.1\n6.1\n6.1\n6.1\n6.1 ANIMALS \u2013 NERVOUS SYSTEM\nANIMALS \u2013 NERVOUS SYSTEM\nANIMALS \u2013 NERVOUS SYSTEM\nANIMALS \u2013 NERVOUS SYSTEM\nANIMALS \u2013 NERVOUS SYSTEM\nIn animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and\nmuscular tissues, which we have studied in Class IX. Touching a hot\nReprint 2025-26\n\n\n[PAGE 2]\nControl and Coordination\n101\nobject is an urgent and dangerous\nsituation for us. We need to detect it,\nand respond to it. How do we detect that\nwe are touching a hot object? All\ninformation from our environment is\ndetected by the specialised tips of some\nnerve cells. These receptors are usually\nlocated in our sense organs, such as the\ninner ear, the nose, the tongue, and so\non. So gustatory receptors will detect taste\nwhile olfactory receptors will detect smell.\nThis information, acquired at the\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[Fig. 6.1 (a)], sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland  [Fig. 6.1 (b)].\nIt is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised\nnetwork of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting\ninformation via electrical impulses from one part of the body to another.\nLook at Fig. 6.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where\ninformation is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an\nelectrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a\nchemical signal for onward transmission.\nActivity 6.1\nActivity 6.1\nActivity 6.1\nActivity 6.1\nActivity 6.1\nn\nPut some sugar in your mouth.
