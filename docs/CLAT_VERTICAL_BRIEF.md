# VOXAM x CLAT Prep

## What We're Building

**VOXAM** is an AI voice examination platform. Students speak their answers instead of typing, and an AI examiner listens, challenges, and adapts in real-time.

We're building a **CLAT Prep vertical** - a specialized AI tutor/examiner specifically for CLAT aspirants.

## Student Experience

### Scenario 1: Legal Reasoning Practice

```
AI:     "Here's a fact pattern: A shopkeeper put up a sign saying
         'Imported chocolates - Rs 500'. A customer picks up a box
         and brings it to the counter. The shopkeeper says the price
         is actually Rs 800.

         Question: Is the shopkeeper bound by the displayed price?
         What's the legal principle here?"

Student: "The shopkeeper is not bound because the display is an
          invitation to treat, not an offer."

AI:     "Good. You've identified the principle correctly. But can
         you explain WHY a price display is an invitation to treat
         and not an offer? What case established this?"

Student: "Um... I think it's because the shopkeeper can't sell to
          everyone, like if stock runs out..."

AI:     "You're on the right track with the practical reasoning.
         The leading case is Pharmaceutical Society v Boots.
         Let me ask you: what's the difference between an offer
         and an invitation to treat in terms of who makes the offer?"
```

### Scenario 2: Logical Reasoning

```
AI:     "Consider this argument: 'All successful lawyers read
         extensively. Rahul reads extensively. Therefore, Rahul
         is a successful lawyer.'

         Is this argument valid? What's the flaw, if any?"

Student: "It's invalid because just because all successful lawyers
          read doesn't mean everyone who reads is a successful lawyer."

AI:     "Correct. What's the name of this logical fallacy?"

Student: "Affirming the consequent?"

AI:     "Exactly. Can you give me another example of this fallacy
         from everyday life?"
```

## Why Voice, Not Text?

| Text-Based Apps | VOXAM Voice |
|-----------------|-------------|
| MCQ - click A, B, C, D | Explain your reasoning out loud |
| Can guess/eliminate | Must actually understand |
| Memorization works | Understanding required |
| No follow-up questions | AI challenges weak points |
| No oral exam practice | Prepares for moot court, vivas |

**Law is verbal.** Lawyers argue, negotiate, cross-examine - all through speech. CLAT tests reasoning, not just recall.

---

## CLAT Sections We'll Cover

| Section | Marks | What We'll Do |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| **English Language** | 22-26 | Comprehension passages, inference questions |
| **Current Affairs/GK** | 28-32 | Last 12 months news, static GK |
| **Legal Reasoning** | 28-32 | Fact patterns, legal principles, case application |
| **Logical Reasoning** | 22-26 | Arguments, assumptions, conclusions |
| **Quantitative** | 10-14 | Basic math, data interpretation |

## What I Need Your Help With

### 1. Is the Structure Right?
- Is the section breakdown above accurate?
- What do students struggle with most?
- What's the time pressure like?

### 2. Legal Reasoning Examples (Most Important)

I need 3-5 sample interactions showing how you'd test someone:

```
PASSAGE/FACT PATTERN:
[The legal scenario]

QUESTIONS TO ASK:
1. [Question about legal principle]
2. [Follow-up probing question]
3. [Challenge question]

GOOD ANSWER:
[What a good student would say]

BAD ANSWER:
[Common mistakes]

HOW TO PUSH BACK:
[How to challenge a weak answer]
```

### 3. What Makes a Good Answer?
- What structure should legal reasoning answers follow? (IRAC?)
- What are examiners looking for?
- What are common mistakes?

### 4. Any Content You Have
If you have any past papers, good passages, or book recommendations - would help a lot.

## What Gap We're Filling

| Current Options | Problem |
|-----------------|---------|
| Unacademy, BYJU's | Video lectures, not interactive |
| Mock test apps | MCQ only, no reasoning required |
| Coaching | Expensive, fixed schedule |

**Us:** Interactive voice practice where you actually have to explain your reasoning.

---

## Questions I Want to Discuss

1. Does this make sense for CLAT aspirants?
2. What would make this NOT useful?
3. How would YOU test someone on legal reasoning?
4. What's broken about current CLAT prep?
