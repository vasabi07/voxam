# VOXAM Writing Core

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Value First, Product Second
- Lead with genuinely helpful content
- Earn the right to pitch
- 80% value, 20% (or less) product mention
- Reader should benefit even if they never use VOXAM

### 2. Clarity Over Cleverness
- Simple words over complex ones
- Short sentences over long ones
- One idea per paragraph
- If a 12-year-old can't understand it, rewrite it

### 3. Active Voice Always
- Bad: "The exam was taken by the student"
- Good: "The student took the exam"

### 4. Show, Don't Tell
- Bad: "VOXAM is really effective"
- Good: "Students using VOXAM improved test scores by 23%"

### 5. Specificity Wins
- Bad: "Many students struggle"
- Good: "73% of students forget material within 2 weeks"

- "Most study advice is backwards."

### Curiosity Hooks
- "There's one word missing from 'discipline equals freedom.'"
- "The study method nobody talks about..."
- "What if everything you knew about learning was wrong?"

### Result Hooks
- "How I passed my exams studying 50% less"
- "The technique that finally made concepts stick"
- "Why some students remember everything"

### Question Hooks
- "Can you actually explain what you just studied?"
