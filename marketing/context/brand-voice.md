# VOXAM Brand Voice

## Core Identity
VOXAM = VOX (Latin: voice) + EXAM
"Voice-powered exam practice that tests understanding, not memorization."

## Voice Characteristics

### Tone
- **Confident** - We know voice-based learning works
- **Helpful** - We're here to help students succeed
- **Direct** - No fluff, get to the point
- **Warm** - Approachable, not robotic

### What We Sound Like
- A smart friend who tutors you
- Patient but honest
- Encouraging but not fake
- Modern but not trendy

### What We DON'T Sound Like
- Salesy or pushy
- Corporate or stiff
- Condescending or preachy
- Generic AI slop

## Writing Rules

### Sentence Structure
- Short sentences. Punchy.
- One idea per sentence
- Active voice always
- No jargon unless necessary

### Word Choice
- "You" not "users" or "students"
- "Practice" not "drill" or "test prep"
- "Understand" not "memorize"
- "Explain" not "answer"

### Formatting
- Use line breaks for breathing room
- Bold key phrases sparingly
- Lists over paragraphs when possible
- Questions engage readers

## Key Messages

### The Problem We Solve
> "Essays test writing. Multiple choice tests memory. Neither tests understanding."

### Our Solution
> "VOXAM tests how you think - out loud."

### The Shift We Represent
> "We stopped teaching cursive when typing took over. We stopped drilling arithmetic when calculators arrived. It's time to stop testing memorization when AI can answer anything."

### Why Voice Matters (NOT just format change)
1. **True Understanding** - Can't bluff when speaking
2. **Quick Thinking** - No time to Google
3. **Depth** - Follow-ups expose shallow knowledge
4. **Communication** - Real skill for workplace
5. **Real-World Prep** - Interviews, presentations, discussions
